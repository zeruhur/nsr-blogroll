Examples of these are 'mortal steel cannot penetrate dragon scales' or 'fairy dust allows you to fly until you touch the ground'. \nIn the game I run for my students I had cultists use a glowing red orb that hypnotises whomever looks at it and makes them obey the commands issued by whomever holds the orb. The cultists used this to abduct an entire town, but after my players saved the townsfolk the orb didn't cease to exist so naturally my players looted it. \nIn the same adventure the players used that orb to hypnotise a giant octopus which they had ticked off. They sealed it in a magic jar and know that if they throw the jar at someth…",

          "description": "Theatre and film are intimately linked mediums of artistic expression. They use many of the same core ingredients (visual, sound and dialogue, time, performance) and even employ most of the same optional conventions (experienced in a single sitting lasting a couple hours, uses non-diegetic music, usually presents the action in its own space and told in roughly real-time for most or all scenes, etc.). Obviously there are exceptions where one medium is used to do something quite different, such as documentary for film or an interactive murder mystery dinner theatre for the stage. But they are closely related media, with film arguably descended directly from theatre. Early film even copied most of theatre's conventions, such as all the action taking place on a \"stage\" viewed from a single, fi…",

Choosing the routes gives players an interesting decision point and discovering the room contents is fun. Saying \"Wait, you said TWO exits on the north wall? I gotta redraw\" is less fun.\n1a. You can still have secret rooms. Seeing the \"gaps\" on the map and finding the door will make players feel smart.\n2.

          "description": "Sometimes one finds oneself in a situation where there is an immediate need to Introduce a new PC to a Party whilst the adventure is currently in progress. Their character falls, and after the comforting clatter of dice, they have made a new one: But by what means do they get ushered into play?\n Here is a table that might supply a skosh of inspiration or at least some “starting points” for these sticky situations where there’s need for a Sudden Entrance, Stage Left. Like most of my tables, it might need a bit of strategic tailoring to the specific situation and taste. Remember the Trick behind all those seemingly stray Capital Letters: Capitalized Words can always be freely substituted/specified/adjusted to fit.\n I’m afraid that most of these might impinge on Player Agency a bit, but I’ve always felt that a player character’s Prologue was fairer game for such things, and it’s a small price to pay for being able to leap back into the action I suppose. I’ve tried to shy away from some of the ones I’ve seen used that put the Character or Player in some of the more uncomfortable spots, and leaning into a bit of mystery and unanswered questions to flesh out in play is never a bad thing in my book. One could even just have them roll (or even select!) an entry that strikes them as that final step of creating their new character. A bit of brief, hopefully  actionable backstory never hurt anyone, and who knows where it could lead? 😊\n Several of these entries are ones I’ve found myself having to use in the past, some even served as Session/Campaign Starters in their own right or Premises for One-Shot Games, so I’m sure there might be a bit of additional hidden utility in this table if one approaches it from other angles.",
