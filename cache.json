It is the next section I am trying to work on for FLoK, but even with the help of some folks who I have run games for, it is slow going. \nTo help the process along, I figured I would make some qualitative systems that sort of line up with how I tend to do things at the table. Mind you, this isn't what I actually consciously have in the back of my head while running, but I think using this will land you in a similar place. \n\nTo help understand where I am coming from it might be useful to keep in mind what my number one principle is when running games: Fluff = Crunch.

          "description": "Character generation in the original FLoK was deliberately sparse because I had no real idea of what the project was going to be yet. \nIt was also one of the areas my playtesters had the most feedback on. Especially the generation of the standard attributes (strength, dex, etc.) was contentious. \nSome disliked that that these tags didn't really come into play, others liked how it informed their idea of their character and the way they roleplayed them. \nThis made me consider making some Maze Rats inspired d66 tables to help those who like that input in visualising and roleplaying their character, without suggesting that these are tags which are supposed to come into play.\nI also tried to standardise the equipment you get from backgrounds a bit more, allow folks to simply roll up their background and provide some examples of those 'twist' items. All also in d66 tables. \nHere's the current results:\n\n\nAll of this is still subject to revision and I might end up deciding I don't like this form of character generation after all. However, the tables seem like they could be useful all the same, so I might as well share them. \nNext up is probably finishing my write up of GM and Player advise. I've noticed I find it hard to explain what I do quite naturally at the table, so I think I might try an example of play that does everything I tend to do when things go well and see if I can't use that as a basis for writing up the advice.",

Assuming I curate the table correctly, a random table brings a feeling of exciting realness to the flow of a game - they ensure I'm not just writing a fantasy novel in front of my players.\nHowever, during a game, I can only have so many *things* in front of me. I'm always thinking, \"Wait, I know I have a d100 list of books around here, where did I put the Dungeon Alphabet?\" In practice, I've become frustrated with how many good tables I know I own vs how many good tables I can bring to hand easily.\nI'm trying to solve this problem with technology. I started experimenting with Perchance.\nHere is a generator I made to run a Middle-earth game set in the Trollshaws:\n\nIf you're looking for a random encounter table to use for your next MERP game, voila!

I'm frontloading the negative, because that aside, it's a truly creative and brilliant show and I really appreciate it for what it is.\n\n\nThis is superhero pastiche done right.

It has a great fireplace on the south wall (which the map seems to give a little crawlspace behind for no explained reason) in which the fire is still burning, but just weakly. There are many benches and tables here, of which a big throne like chair is sitting in the north, in which the leader will hold court when needed. \n\n\nThis is a great place to take the adventurers if they are captured at any point. The leader likes to hold court and to flaunt his power and wealth. This could be a good place for a hearing. It would be farcical and very silly.

This goes very slowly as we're playing it in sessions as short as 5 minutes at the time sometimes. This time, a student of 7 years old made an adventurer character called Robin the Ninja, using my regular Risus setup and B2 - Keep on the Borderlands.\nSo enter Jason the Ninja:\n\n\nNinja 4\nLanguage Buff 3\nBasketball Player 2\nCook 1\n\n\nHe decided he wanted to check out the caves for treasure so we went on our way and I rolled to see if there was a random encounter. Or I just decided to roll to see which random encounter he came upon, I can't remember. It was weeks ago. I rolled up a giant gecko, which I just explained as a giant lizard. I googled a picture of a dimetrodon and showed that to him. I improvised a little scene to make it interesting. The beast was sunning on a log while a knight in armour with a broken shield and sword was laying on the ground going \"Ow! Ow! Owowowowowowow! That was a bad idea!\"\nJason the Ninja went on to kick the Giant Lizard (3) without getting a scratch on himself. I made it a drawn out combat encounter, rather than a one roll type of encounter. He didn't get hit once, and made the lizard ran off (I let him narrate his own victory). He then carried the knight back to the castle to save him. I asked him his favorite colour and his favorite vegetable, because ... I dunno, it's silly, and made it into the name of the knight. He had now made a friend. Sir Richard Bluecarrot will accompany him on his adventures from now on, if able. Jason immediately started to train the knight in the art of the Ninja \"so he can protect himself\", providing him with a trampoline to practice his flips, succeeding in it.\nAnd that's where this part ended.\nSir Richard Bluecarrot:\n\n\nKnight 3\nNinja 2",

I’ve always been fond of unique Magic Users, but most of the time I don’t use or create a new Class/Subclass for them. There’s a significant amount of customization that can take place elsewhere to capture a different feel for a Wonder Worker, and in addition to just modifying Spell Lists/Creating New Spells, I like to tweak their process of Preparing Spells.\n These modifications are mostly cosmetic in nature and I’d assume that whatever materials or paraphernalia affiliated with these consumes about as much Inventory Space/Encumbrance as a standard Spellbook, and perhaps even possessses a degree of similar fragility. Losing a Spellbook is never fun, and I’m sure there are interesting and creative ways Players could discover that would end up with them losing access to some of these. \n As I was working on this, it struck me that it might perform a bit of lovely double duty as a list of strange Rituals associated with woefully un-specified Spell Acquisition or under-detailed Magical Research as well.

          "description": "Musing the other day about Randomizing the Players’ Starting Equipment (why would this Magic User have a suit of Chainmail Armor?) got me thinking: What if some of a Character’s Initial Gear could serve as a bit of double duty somehow? It would be fun if one of the items they began play with had a little History, or even maybe an Adventure Hook/Rumor/bit of Mystery to pursue right out of the gate. As a big proponent of a more Sandbox-style of play, one can never have enough seeds to broadcast into those initially fallow fields in hopes that something sprouts, so naturally I felt another table was in order 😊.\n   \nAt first, I had contemplated dividing this up into categories like Weapons/Armor/Tools and such, but gradually started leaning toward attempting to make the entries at least somewhat applicable to all (as you never know what the players will decide to spend that 3d6 x 100 on or select from my Quick Equipment & Encumbrance Sheet). Some Referees perform this Shopping portion of Character Generation in play, and not all of these may be appropriate with that method, but there could be some inspiration found below for roleplaying cues I suppose.\n Gut-feeling tells me that these would likely work best with the more durable pieces of gear on the Adventure Equipment list of your choice but it might lead to interesting situations to attach something like this to a consumable like a single Torch or Arrow. Could lead to a tough choice down the road eventually. \n I do have an additional d100 for Equipment here, but this list doesn’t include the “bread and butter” of Arms and Armor.

Even now D&D's combat rules continue to evolve, increasing in complexity and offering ever more variability, steadily accreting to form the 100’s of pages of rules, customization options, feats, spells and mechanics that allow the current edition to function almost as a tactical game of fantasy superpowers and feat usage.\n\n\n\n\nI’m not going to catalog, debate, or mock…",

More risk equals more opportunity for tense sessions and horror!\nsquads\nSquad is a group of contractors united by mission and proficiencies.
