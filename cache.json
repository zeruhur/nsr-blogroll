          "description": "The \"Mythic Underworld\" is a term popular in the OSR that I believe was coined by Jason Cone in Philotomy's Musings. Cone argued that the rules of OD&D can be interpreted to suggest that the \"dungeons\" that adventurers delve into aren't really to be understood as real, logical spaces created by normal people or natural processes. Rather, they're more like a surreal, dreamlike, and hostile realm that runs on its own twisted logic, which might be inconsistent. It gives the referee some leeway to make a contrived, game-y, \"funhouse\" dungeon instead of stressing about accuracy or rationality.\n\nMuch of what Cone describes are just traits of megadungeons, or even simply dungeons in general. Things like, \"non-linear pathways\" and \"lots of connections between levels\" aren't really mythic, they're …",

He mainly works as a mercenary for the forces of Chaos. He recently has come in possession of an unholy symbol of the dark forces, that will slowly corrupt his mind, offering him dark powers. Gros Jean has an agreement with the Witch Magobia that if the goblins pay him, he will protect them, as he can have some of the babies she brings in as food.\n\n\nWhen Gros Jean is met in the wild he…\n 1. Is eating and will tolerate weary travelers to join. \n2. Is admiring his ruby necklace of the Snake.\n 3. Has a manacled prisoner on a chain and is sitting down with a pensive smile brainstorming on an apt punishment for the oath the prisoner broke. \n4. Is very hungry and looking for food. You look tasty. Or do you perhaps have a baby?\n 5. Is grumpy and angry because his prisoner escaped. \n6. Is hanging chains with stone skulls on them on a prisoner. One for each of the men he promised to bring back safely, but failed to do so. He has to cary these around wherever they go.\n\n\nOgres are descendants of the old Roman deity called Orcus. They roam the world, eating babies (preferably) and enjoying in punishing oath-breakers. \n\n\nThere are more ogres in the land, but not a lot. They do not get along very much and as such remain a good distance away from each other. If they get too close to each other, the land cannot sustain their appetite all that much and they will fight over food. Sometimes an ogre will find a mate though, and somehow they manage to tolerate each other. Woe betide the lands where this is the case.",

And I will not be talking about landings here, since wings aren’t crucial for that. Instead I will introduce you to the concept of aerogravity assist.\nNot to be confused with aerobreaking, which is a manoeuvre that uses the atmosphere of a planet to slow down a spacecraft. Aerogravity assist uses the atmosphere to speed up instead.\nA common manoeuvre in space travel is the gravity assist—using a planets gravity well as a slingshot to deflect your trajectory. The closer you get to the planet, the more your course will be changed. The issue is that you are limited by the planets atmosphere. If you come too close, the drag will significantly reduce your speed and the costs will outweigh the benefits.\n…",

I want to explore roleplaying through the lens of these loops. Why though? To me the advantage of understanding game loops is intentionally using them in play and design (of systems and adventures alike). By making them explicit (or intentionally subtle) the table can focus on making interesting decisions and narrating the fiction.\nGame loops can also inform the base units of your fictional world. Loops that deal with space and time will be better suited for location exploration. While loops that are focused on events and narrative beats are more apt for scene based play.\nIn a video game, these loops are coded in by the designers, and revealed to us as eithe…",
