          "description": "The \"Mythic Underworld\" is a term popular in the OSR that I believe was coined by Jason Cone in Philotomy's Musings. Cone argued that the rules of OD&D can be interpreted to suggest that the \"dungeons\" that adventurers delve into aren't really to be understood as real, logical spaces created by normal people or natural processes. Rather, they're more like a surreal, dreamlike, and hostile realm that runs on its own twisted logic, which might be inconsistent. It gives the referee some leeway to make a contrived, game-y, \"funhouse\" dungeon instead of stressing about accuracy or rationality.\n\nMuch of what Cone describes are just traits of megadungeons, or even simply dungeons in general. Things like, \"non-linear pathways\" and \"lots of connections between levels\" aren't really mythic, they're …",

But it wormed the game into my brain and eventually I scrounged pdf's for it out of the corners of the internet and read through them. \n\n\nAnd I was charmed. Its an old, idiosyncratic game but interesting in its presentation of details and has some surprisingly well made modules.

I loved it, and would listen to it over and over again until I had every bit memorized. Not so much every word, or even the specifics of the story, but every turn of the music was etched into my imagination. The characters spoke to me not through their literal actions, but through the way they were portrayed by the orchestra.

Into an imperfect world and into the confusion of life it brings a temporary, a limited perfection. Play demands order absolute and supreme. The least deviation from it \"spoils the game\", robs it of its character and makes it worthless.”\n- Homo Ludens\n\nHomo Ludens is a foundational work in the scholarship of games or “play” and of cultural history more generally. Written by the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga and published in 1938, it defines play as a distinct natural activity that exists outside everyday survival, only for the purpose of freedom and fun. However, a major element separates play from other leisure activities—play requires rules. \nPlay produces “games” or …",

Kris is trying to figure out what happened on the research station.\nIn this post I wanted to talk about using objects and locations in RPGs to tell a history or fiction. I believe we already use environmental storytelling in our games, however I wanted to delve deeper—understand how we can consciously apply this concept to our settings.\nMotivation\nThe OSR play culture is particularly interested in exploring fantastical locations. Lots of focus is put into creating these spaces that the referee describes to the players. In turn, the players are expected to interact in these spaces as much as possible. Players usually explore ruins or derelicts of some kind, so the objects within them will always have a history.\nIf you are playing a mystery game, en…",

And I will not be talking about landings here, since wings aren’t crucial for that. Instead I will introduce you to the concept of aerogravity assist.\nNot to be confused with aerobreaking, which is a manoeuvre that uses the atmosphere of a planet to slow down a spacecraft. Aerogravity assist uses the atmosphere to speed up instead.\nA common manoeuvre in space travel is the gravity assist—using a planets gravity well as a slingshot to deflect your trajectory. The closer you get to the planet, the more your course will be changed. The issue is that you are limited by the planets atmosphere. If you come too close, the drag will significantly reduce your speed and the costs will outweigh the benefits.\n…",

I want to explore roleplaying through the lens of these loops. Why though? To me the advantage of understanding game loops is intentionally using them in play and design (of systems and adventures alike). By making them explicit (or intentionally subtle) the table can focus on making interesting decisions and narrating the fiction.\nGame loops can also inform the base units of your fictional world. Loops that deal with space and time will be better suited for location exploration. While loops that are focused on events and narrative beats are more apt for scene based play.\nIn a video game, these loops are coded in by the designers, and revealed to us as eithe…",
