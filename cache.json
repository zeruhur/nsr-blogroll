          "description": "Intro: Overpowered Abilities\nA staple of my recent design is to work with absolutes whenever possible. This is because to me, these are a lot easier to track. Examples of these are 'mortal steel cannot penetrate dragon scales' or 'fairy dust allows you to fly until you touch the ground'. \nIn the game I run for my students I had cultists use a glowing red orb that hypnotises whomever looks at it and makes them obey the commands issued by whomever holds the orb. The cultists used this to abduct an entire town, but after my players saved the townsfolk the orb didn't cease to exist so naturally my players looted it. \nIn the same adventure the players used that orb to hypnotise a giant octopus which they had ticked off. They sealed it in a magic jar and know that if they throw the jar at someth…",

          "description": "\"There is no canon.\"\nThis, I feel, is the best way to deal with worldbuilding in tRPGs. Rather than fight against the given fact that people will alter your work based on the preferences and needs of their tables, you can learn to embrace it and actively make settings that do not have a canon, or at least very little canon. There are a number of ways I have seen folks embrace this idea: from sharing unfinished projects and incomplete thoughts to publishing material that deliberately leaves gaps that need to be filled in during prep or at the table. \n\nLuka Rejec is the one I found that first called this sort of writing anti-canon, but Chris McDowall makes references to similar thoughts (and I consider Electric Bastionland to be the pinacle of this sort of anti-canon worldbuilding), and Arno…",

Add a job and a relationship to this and I have not nearly enough time to do all the things that interest me. In short: there is little time for me to run and prep tRPGs. \n\nThis has made me obsessed with efficiency, both when running games as well as when I design tRPG stuff. On the design end of things, Chris McDowall's minimalism has been really influential in this and his work is something I consider the gold standard to aim for myself. But it turns out that when running games I am already quite efficient with my time.\n\nThrough surveying my players for the FLOK playtest I learned that all of them seemed in agreement that I run my games fast.

They use many of the same core ingredients (visual, sound and dialogue, time, performance) and even employ most of the same optional conventions (experienced in a single sitting lasting a couple hours, uses non-diegetic music, usually presents the action in its own space and told in roughly real-time for most or all scenes, etc.). Obviously there are exceptions where one medium is used to do something quite different, such as documentary for film or an interactive murder mystery dinner theatre for the stage. But they are closely related media, with film arguably descended directly from theatre. Early film even copied most of theatre's conventions, such as all the action taking place on a \"stage\" viewed from a single, fi…",

Worry not though. It's a decently system-flexible adventure good for all medieval-ish fantasy dungeoncrawlers. If you are a 5E player, it provides some lite mechanical support to run the adventure in a more old-school way.\n\n\nThe premise? \"Evil druid cult.\" An ever-elusive archetype but one that I think Harald has nailed here. If you've never used druids as villains, you should really give it a whirl.\n\n\nIt's a medium-sized dungeon that's non-linear, has lots and lots of dangers (especially weird fungi), and has clean and helpful formatting.

This post was originally drafted in like 2019 and I was never sure what to do with it. I've had some similar ideas lately, I intend to explore some version of this further in the near future.\n\n\n\nThey say that when you die, your brain floods with DMT, the chemical of dreams. Your perception of time slows and you relive your life as synapses die and memories pop into being one last time. Memories are fuzzy and imperfect things, and in your psychedelic dreamscape your life plays out a little bit differently. Then, your dreamscape self dies, and it floods with DMT, and so recursively, at the moment of your death, you dream and live your entire multiverse of selves.\nThese recursive multiversal selves exist in a metaphysical space, a space of souls, where the soul-self opens the gate of the pineal gland and enters the collective unconscious.\nAnd what are undead, if not liminal beings, a physical, synaptic consciousness at the gate, lacking a soul, the apparatus to join the collective unconscious? Zombies don't hunger for brains, they hunger for souls. But no matter how hard they try, no matter how many brains they consume, they'll never be able to digest, to integrate, the soul. Weep for the pitiful hungry zombie. Vampires, lich lords, and other intelligent undead sleep, but without a soul, what do they dream?\nThey do not relive their lives, but the lives of those whose brains they've eaten, blood they've drank, bodies they've necromantically revived; damaged and mutated, the undigested souls linger within, propagating through a dark multiverse of astral un-life, the reciprocation of undeath, a limbo dimension of null that exists, cruelly, to balance the physical inequality of energy that undeath introduces into the universe. The undead dream the purgatory of the living.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I made my first post on the collaborative blog Iconoclastic Flow!\nIconoclastic Rant: I am sick of being asked \"but how would that work?\"",

          "description": "WotC just dropped news that they'll be bringing back the AD+D 2e settings of Spelljammer and Dragonlance. You can read all about that over at EnWorld if you're so inclined. \nI never got into Spelljammer -- I missed a chance to pick up some of the old boxed sets for literal pennies, and I still kick myself for it -- but the concept still holds loads of intrinsic appeal to me. I don't feel like I've seen a satisfying treatment of naval play in a D+D framework yet, and I'm curious to see how WotC approaches it. (I suspect that their approach to voyages and space probably won't be one that quite scratches the yearnings I have, but seeing how they tackle it certainly isn't a bad thing.) \nBut Dragonlance? Dragonlance was one of my main entrypoints into D+D. I started off with the superlative Ret…",

          "description": "I had a thought today. \nLet's treat is as pasta and throw it to the digital wall to see if it sticks.\nRecently on the Cauldron forums there were some thoughts and wishes for divides between different communities of play to be crossed somehow. Combine this with me thinking recently that it would be fun to play Electric Bastionland with a system that suits my story-telling sensibilities a bit more. I was thinking RISUS, since that's my go to, but then I got to thinking about FATE Core's Session 0.\nYou see, not only do you create your own character in FATE Core if played, RAW, but you also work together to decide which setting, genre, theme's, etc. there would be in this game. And that's where I was thinking that it would be fun to take electric Bastionland's Borough creation (or the other types of maps) and make it a communal thing. I've attempted making it communal in the beginning of this year with the kids, but using end of class time is a bit short, so that failed. But with this I can revisit it. Everyone could take turns adding routes, choosing the type of road it is, etc. Besides that, keep the two aspects for the game itself: Current Issues and Impending Issues. These can fuel and/or be fueled by whatever is created already, be it faces and places or something like that.\nThe Faces and Places from Fate create instant NPC's to place on the map (if they are on the map) or to tie to the greater world. The Spark Tables and the Backgrounds of Electric Bastionland cans till be rolled on or used as inspiration for creating our starting situation.\nI don't know if this is a thing that I will have time to test out anytime soon, but I hope to try it out soon-ish.",

Spontaneous Namecraft is a tad tricky though. When Naming things, should I have the luxury, I do tend to try to speak it aloud a few times, just to ensure that it flows off the tongue without too much stumbling and can’t be inadvertently mispronounced into something silly or humorous (a very common conundrum in my games that can be a bit derailing). While onomastics are intensely interesting to me, I’m usually a little more concerned with having something immediately accessible to solve the problem.\n Specifically, I find myself often in need of Names for Gods/Deities/Tutelary Spirits and such for How I…",

Over the weekend, I had the fortune of starting a fire and socializing with some friends outdoors. Quite a bit of food for thought and inspiration in that experience.\n I’ve tried to shy away from dictating too much by way of Terrains or directly engaging Procedures with these (Encounters can still be handled through your standard preferred mechanisms after all), but some have probably stealthily crept in. Definitely a chance I might revisit this with more specificity down the road for some Seasonality/Environmental tailoring. I also tried to vary things up a little bit: Some with weal, others woe, but usually rather inconsequential or minor in nature (this might dovetail with later Tables that use a Reaction Roll I do love those bell curves after all, or even by Overloading some existing rolls). A few of my favorites are the more Neutral Campfire Story ones where Players get asked about things. Entries more focused in this direction might need to end up on their own little table eventually now that I think about it, because I love how those types of Questions interface with character development in play. 😊",

But sometimes I like to house these “single-serving Spells” in other, less traditional actions and items. These might be especially useful for Magical Traditions that encode their dweomers in ways that are not dependent on literacy or pulped wood, or just atypical treasures placed for a slight change of pace.\n Standard Scroll rules would apply for these. I would personally still stick with my favorite Creation Rules from Holmes (100 gp and 1 week per Spell Level, halve time or cost with the appropriate Reagents/Ingredients).\n Here’s a Hundred alternatives to consider in the place of that voluted vellum. Perhaps every caster learns a different method from their Mentor, as a sort of signature? These might also mesh nicely with my One Hundred Spellbook Surrogates & Ritual Research table.",

Dammit, that's basically Skyrim. Still doing it.\n\nWhat do you do when you realize your idea is too close to a book/movie/game? Roll with it? Scrap it?\n\nResponse:\n\n\n\n\nFuck originality.\n\nIt will become original through the amazingly imaginative things your friends do in response to it all and the game and your decisions in the moment as the dice add their element.\n\nDon't sweat it.
