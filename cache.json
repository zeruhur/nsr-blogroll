          "description": "Intro: Overpowered Abilities\nA staple of my recent design is to work with absolutes whenever possible. This is because to me, these are a lot easier to track. Examples of these are 'mortal steel cannot penetrate dragon scales' or 'fairy dust allows you to fly until you touch the ground'. \nIn the game I run for my students I had cultists use a glowing red orb that hypnotises whomever looks at it and makes them obey the commands issued by whomever holds the orb. The cultists used this to abduct an entire town, but after my players saved the townsfolk the orb didn't cease to exist so naturally my players looted it. \nIn the same adventure the players used that orb to hypnotise a giant octopus which they had ticked off. They sealed it in a magic jar and know that if they throw the jar at someth…",

          "description": "Theatre and film are intimately linked mediums of artistic expression. They use many of the same core ingredients (visual, sound and dialogue, time, performance) and even employ most of the same optional conventions (experienced in a single sitting lasting a couple hours, uses non-diegetic music, usually presents the action in its own space and told in roughly real-time for most or all scenes, etc.). Obviously there are exceptions where one medium is used to do something quite different, such as documentary for film or an interactive murder mystery dinner theatre for the stage. But they are closely related media, with film arguably descended directly from theatre. Early film even copied most of theatre's conventions, such as all the action taking place on a \"stage\" viewed from a single, fi…",

Choosing the routes gives players an interesting decision point and discovering the room contents is fun. Saying \"Wait, you said TWO exits on the north wall? I gotta redraw\" is less fun.\n1a. You can still have secret rooms. Seeing the \"gaps\" on the map and finding the door will make players feel smart.\n2.

This would have been the very tail-end of that style of animation.\n\n\nMy understanding is that the original Getter Robo, along with Mazinger Z*, were the two original and still most archetypal \"Super Robot\" Mecha anime, but Getter Robo Armageddon is more like a sequel or spiritual sequel to the original series, set after a Getter-related apocalyptic event.

With a more Mythic Underworld approach, in some of these frightening places every Door might require some Forcing for delvers and interlopers (while they are whisper quiet and open readily for Monsters of course).

Over the weekend, I had the fortune of starting a fire and socializing with some friends outdoors. Quite a bit of food for thought and inspiration in that experience.\n I’ve tried to shy away from dictating too much by way of Terrains or directly engaging Procedures with these (Encounters can still be handled through your standard preferred mechanisms after all), but some have probably stealthily crept in. Definitely a chance I might revisit this with more specificity down the road for some Seasonality/Environmental tailoring. I also tried to vary things up a little bit: Some with weal, others woe, but usually rather inconsequential or minor in nature (this might dovetail with later Tables that use a Reaction Roll I do love those bell curves after all, or even by Overloading some existing rolls). A few of my favorites are the more Neutral Campfire Story ones where Players get asked about things. Entries more focused in this direction might need to end up on their own little table eventually now that I think about it, because I love how those types of Questions interface with character development in play. 😊",

Swaggering and joking among each other, not really expecting anything. \n\n\nB. 1d4 ghosts, singing and muttering their lines, will ask you to join in a play, if satisfied they will gift you a silver gilded thespian mask, if refused they will conjure up a miniature tempest.\n\n\nC.

A very large and obvious iron key ring hangs on the far wall.\n\n\n\"Empty\"\n\n\nThe stage, wooden boards sagging and pierced through with growing trees in places, looking up you can see the whole of the encircling bleachers.\n\n\nOld musty prop closets, digging around unearths two intact silk robes and a tarnished silver amulet. \n\n\nA gnarled tree growing out of the stands, its roots split apart the stones allowing one to easily drop down into an old dusty under-passage. \n\n\nSpecial \n\n\nThe acoustics when standing in the seats are perfect to amplify any sounds three-fold and let you displace it as though a ventriloquist anywhere in the structure. \n\n\nNon-Player Character\n\n\nUmberto, an amateur con artist the brigands mistook for a noble and are holding captive.
