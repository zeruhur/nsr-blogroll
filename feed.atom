This can sometimes demystify these majestic Monsters a bit, so here’s a table that might provide some additional inspiration to surprise and bewilder by eschewing that predictability. Should you need an unusual shade for their scales to shimmer see the perchance generator below.
  
Naturally, one should assume that any standard effects and procedures associated with being doused in Dragon Breath should apply. These are merely adjuncts. Coupled with my prior post on Monster Special Attacks, I suppose this could also be used for foes of a less draconic nature should this be your bag.]]></summary>

Mecha are sometimes described as being a metaphor for the body- which makes sense, they are humanoid giant robots, often unnecessarily anthropomorphized, and often used to tell stories about the adolescent experience or the brutality of war. I don't mean to suggest this is all that Mecha entail, but this alone can be explored in ways that I have rarely if ever seen.

For the shift that I was in, there would be three games that would be played, an 1st Edition AD&D game, a home-brew game and Starfinder. I had signed up for Starfinder. The day before I heard that Starfinder was cancelled as the GM had contracted Covid. I said that there was no problem, I would come and either join one of the other games or quickly do some kind of improv game.
I arrived, barely on time on Saturday, with some options in my backpack, which turned out to be nice, because of all the people that had said they would come, only four people were there, including the organizer. The guy running first edition needed 6 people for his game…]]></summary>

I've been working for a while now on a new game. Confusingly, I'm calling it G&G (Goblets & Grues), which is what my failed project from over a year ago was also called.

What can I say? I really like the name. This is just a short post about a new mechanic I just added to the draft rules that I'm really excited to try out.

So, the idea of this new G&G is to combine a focus on exploration and problem solving with a light emphasis on tactical combat. I miss 5E and how the differentiation of roles in combat makes every player feel important.
How to marry these two things? The two approaches seem irreconcilable...

Pokemon is obviously a huge decades-long phenomenon of a franchise requiring no introduction. Yet despite this fact, I am surprised by just how little impact it has had on fiction, how little regard is paid to the fact that it is a unique science fiction or fantasy sub-genre. My intention for this post is to describe what I think makes Pokemon unique as a sub-genre, and using that as a case example for how to go about thinking about works of fiction and how they might be extrapolated into new kinds of sub-genres, which can then be explored in tabletop RPG form.

Perhaps it’s their Inherently Magical Nature that inspires this, or mythological traditions such as Sigurd inadvertently gaining the Language of Birds whilst roasting Fafnir’s Heart in the Völsunga saga.

When I was 12, I was introduced to RPGs. I said "Oh I will make one for Lord of the Rings." I went home and wrote it in a notebook. 
It was terrible. 
For the last 20 years, I have been chasing this white whale. Here is what I have learned:
There is no one, perfect game. There is only the perfect game for the campaign you want to run (some assembly required). 
If you want to run a Tolkien game, there are a lot of resources to help you assemble the right game for you, both licensed and unlicensed. 
What's this post about?
Given this story and this blog I suspect no one is surprised that I have Opinions (TM) about Lord of the Rings games. 
Here is a blog post about licensed Tolkien games.

The Gyldir Vale is a temperate river valley enclosed by the sharp and rocky Red Range to the west; the ancient, forested Green Range to the east; and the magnificent, snow-capped White Range to the north.


The valley's name is derived from the Golden Flame, the mysterious source of power with which Rotangur barbarians conquered this land from the high elves 1,000 years ago.


The Common Church denounces the Golden Flame as the work of the Devil, but some whisper that the Flame was a gift of divine grace, granted to the Rotangur by the pagan gods of their northern lands.

One item periodically perceived as “Missing” from OSE and B/X is a quick and convenient way to instantaneously identify the functions of recovered Magical Items.
 The methods outlined within the text seem to circumscribe this process to either Experimentation or saving up to pay the exorbitant prices of Sages, Seers, and other such Specialists (a lovely money-sink in itself). The “Retainer Test Subject” approach seldom seems appealing to players, since the “Guinea Pig” often clamors to keep it (and why should they not? They assumed the risk!). Later versions, obviously informed by experiences with how these options tended to play out, mostly do away with these methods altoget…]]></summary>

I'm frontloading the negative, because that aside, it's a truly creative and brilliant show and I really appreciate it for what it is.


This is superhero pastiche done right. On the surface of it, it feels very rooted in Justice League and Marvel/DC-style superhero tropes, as well as the full gamut of Watchmen, Dark Knight Returns, the 1980's, videogames, etc. Even so, as the sum of its parts, it feels unique, and that is in large part due to …]]></summary>

Room 9: The Banquet Area (This Is A Capital “L” Location)
If you keep going to the left of the entrance, you reach the Banquet Area. It has a great fireplace on the south wall (which the map seems to give a little crawlspace behind for no explained reason) in which the fire is still burning, but just weakly. There are many benches and tables here, of which a big throne like chair is sitting in the north, in which the leader will hold court when needed. 


This is a great place to take the adventurers if they are captured at any point. The leader likes to hold court and to flaunt his power and wealth. This could be a good place for a hearing.

So this is a Mosaic Strict procedure that provides a structure for players to model a romantic relationship. In a lot of ways Lines and Circles strikes me as a lyric game. It’s interesting to read, beautiful in a way, esoteric, and only kind of a game.

Pig Faced Orc by Trash Mob Minis



In the game I play with the kids using RISUS, the orcs are Pig Men who are dirty, gluttonous and lazy. Evil is also comically evil in this game, because I’m playing with young kids. This makes these encounters and scenes a lot more fun than dangerous, though there is danger and —depending on the sensibilities of the kids— lethal. Though situations should play out in such a way that evil should not triumph but rather defeat itself.


I started thinking about this because in the game I play when we’re done early in class, the kid made it until the caves and decided to check out cave C. So I’ve been reading that entry lately, thinking about how I could run it for this 6 or 7 year old kid. And I tho…]]></summary>

The combat mechanics of Classic fantasy RPGs are a huge source of both debate and game design innovation. The first official changes to Dungeons & Dragons in “Supplement 1 - Greyhawk” are changes to combat mechanics (variable Hit Dice, including weapon damage and Hit Points by class) that form a central aspect of every subsequent edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Even now D&D's combat rules continue to evolve, increasing in complexity and offering ever more variability, steadily accreting to form the 100’s of pages of rules, customization options, feats, spells and mechanics that allow the current edition to function almost as a tactical game of fantasy superpowers and feat usage.

Continuing from part 2, I'm exploring some alternatives to the traditional role that money and economics plays in D&D, inspired by real-life situations found in history, with the occasional creative liberty taken here or there to make things more gameable. It's fantasy after all, we're not going to stress about accuracy here. Last time I just talked about small-to-medium adjustments to the existing economic situations your players engage in. This time I want to think bigger picture. In traditional, OSR, "XP for Gold" schemes, dungeoneering is a path that leads to domains being built up for each individual player. But what other campaign arcs shaped by treasure can we imagine?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In moving forward with the idea of using Tarsos Theorem's Concept Crafting for the basis of my Mecha Gear system in Maximum Recursion Depth 2, I have run a series of "Mock Session 0 Playtests", discussing the setting, game mechanics, and character creation with people as if we were going to run a game (and in one case, it actually is going to be an ongoing IRL Campaign!).


I've been pleasantly surprised the extent to which people have responded really positively to the Playtests- it feels like I have demonstrably learned from MRD1 and have gotten better at conveying information and setting expectations, and also in game design itself. One of the playtests was with the first group I ran the earliest version of MRD1, and they said they liked the idea of MRD2 even better and were interested …]]></summary>

Akin to my generator for Remarkable Birds, this kind of set dressing and these in-world “Common Names” can sometimes add a little bit of fun or interesting detail to the Wilderness Foraging, Catch-monger Stalls, or even the occasional Wave-Crawl. One column might also be useful for quick descriptors of seafood dishes the players might deign to dine upon.
 I’ve also included a handy Perchance Generator below to speed up generation of these aquatic critters.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we have some time left over at the end of the lessons, we sometimes play some RPG. This goes very slowly as we're playing it in sessions as short as 5 minutes at the time sometimes. This time, a student of 7 years old made an adventurer character called Robin the Ninja, using my regular Risus setup and B2 - Keep on the Borderlands.
So enter Jason the Ninja:


Ninja 4
Language Buff 3
Basketball Player 2
Cook 1


He decided he wanted to check out the caves for treasure so we went on our way and I rolled to see if there was a random encounter. Or I just decided to roll to see which random encounter he came upon, I can't remember. It was weeks ago. I rolled up a giant gecko, which I just explained as a giant lizard. I googled a picture of a dimetrodon and showed that to him. I improvised a little scene to make it interesting. The beast was sunning on a log while a knight in armour with a broken shield and sword was laying on the ground going "Ow! Ow! Owowowowowowow! That was a bad idea!"
Jason the Ninja went on to kick the Giant Lizard (3) without getting a scratch on himself. I made it a drawn out combat encounter, rather than a one roll type of encounter. He didn't get hit once, and made the lizard ran off (I let him narrate his own victory). He then carried the knight back to the castle to save him. I asked him his favorite colour and his favorite vegetable, because ... I dunno, it's silly, and made it into the name of the knight. He had now made a friend. Sir Richard Bluecarrot will accompany him on his adventures from now on, if able. Jason immediately started to train the knight in the art of the Ninja "so he can protect himself", providing him with a trampoline to practice his flips, succeeding in it.
And that's where this part ended.
Sir Richard Bluecarrot:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What do I do as the Warden during Shore Leave? This post will aim to answer the question, providing more depth to Shore Leave phases based on Mothership 1e mechanics. Using a downtime die and faction turns can create opportunities for new missions, and are generally helpful for worldbuilding. And as I say in every post, these rules are super modular. You can adjust them to your taste and the specifics of your campaign.
downtime die
While your characters rest in port, the world around them changes. The downtime die is a special kind of die that is rolled every Shore Leave phase. It is introduced to simulate the growth of various dangers and factions. Similar to the derelict die, it is meant as a guiding tool to help the warden flesh out the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a big fan of random tables. Assuming I curate the table correctly, a random table brings a feeling of exciting realness to the flow of a game - they ensure I'm not just writing a fantasy novel in front of my players.
However, during a game, I can only have so many *things* in front of me. I'm always thinking, "Wait, I know I have a d100 list of books around here, where did I put the Dungeon Alphabet?" In practice, I've become frustrated with how many good tables I know I own vs how many good tables I can bring to hand easily.
I'm trying to solve this problem with technology. I started experimenting with Perchance.
Here is a generator I made to run a Middle-earth game set in the Trollshaws:
