        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My recent post on Haven Happenings spawned a sibling of sorts in the form of this table to cover something a little similar, but instead geared more toward those Times when Overland Travel comes to a stop (Camping, Resting, etc.). Over the weekend, I had the fortune of starting a fire and socializing with some friends outdoors. Quite a bit of food for thought and inspiration in that experience.
 I’ve tried to shy away from dictating too much by way of Terrains or directly engaging Procedures with these (Encounters can still be handled through your standard preferred mechanisms after all), but some have probably stealthily crept in. Definitely a chance I might revisit this with more specificity down the road for some Seasonality/Environmental tailoring. I also tried to vary things up a little bit: Some with weal, others woe, but usually rather inconsequential or minor in nature (this might dovetail with later Tables that use a Reaction Roll I do love those bell curves after all, or even by Overloading some existing rolls). A few of my favorites are the more Neutral Campfire Story ones where Players get asked about things. Entries more focused in this direction might need to end up on their own little table eventually now that I think about it, because I love how those types of Questions interface with character development in play. 😊]]></summary>

"Related: I would love to see the OD&D Outdoor Survival map become more a defacto map that everyone iterates on. Outdoor Survival map provides that richer environment. Also easier to provide your own spin on a recipe when the base is worked out like a chocolate chip cookie recipe."

It's available as a Pay What You Want download on the Dungeon Master's Guild. Worry not though. It's a decently system-flexible adventure good for all medieval-ish fantasy dungeoncrawlers. If you are 5E player, it provides some lite mechanical support to run the adventure in a more old-school way.


The premise? "Evil druid cult." An ever-elusive archetype but one that I think Harald has nailed here. If you've never used druids as villains, you should really give it a whirl.


It's a medium-sized dungeon that's non-linear, has lots and lots of dangers (especially weird fungi), and has clean and helpful formatting. It'll make a fine addition to anyone's collection of solid, vanilla-yet-tasty dungeons to slot into their game.]]></summary>

These might be especially useful for Magical Traditions that encode their dweomers in ways that are not dependent on literacy or pulped wood, or just atypical treasures placed for a slight change of pace.
 Standard Scroll rules would apply for these. I would personally still stick with my favorite Creation Rules from Holmes (100 gp and 1 week per Spell Level, halve time or cost with the appropriate Reagents/Ingredients).
 Here’s a Hundred alternatives to consider in the place of that voluted vellum. Perhaps every caster learns a different method from their Mentor, as a sort of signature? These might also mesh nicely with my One Hundred Spellbook Surrogates & Ritual Research table.]]></summary>

tl;dr Fuck originality.

OP
So I'm working on some history for my world and I get this great idea. My players are finding these objects of unidentifiable ancient magic, and I wasn't sure what they were for yet. Then I thought well they're solving these draconic riddles to reach the objects, maybe they're like seals placed a thousand years ago by a dragon cult to seal evil dragons away in the earth! Cool! Dammit, that's basically Skyrim. Still doing it.

What do you do when you realize your idea is too close to a book/movie/game? Roll with it? Scrap it?

Response:




Fuck originality.

It will become original through the amazingly imaginative things your friends do in response to it all and the game and your decisions in the moment as the dice add their element.

Don't sweat it. Unleash your friends on it.]]></summary>

Let's treat is as pasta and throw it to the digital wall to see if it sticks.
Recently on the Cauldron forums there were some thoughts and wishes for divides between different communities of play to be crossed somehow. Combine this with me thinking recently that it would be fun to play Electric Bastionland with a system that suits my story-telling sensibilities a bit more. I was thinking RISUS, since that's my go to, but then I got to thinking about FATE Core's Session 0.
You see, not only do you create your own character in FATE Core if played, RAW, but you also work together to decide which setting, genre, theme's, etc. there would be in this game. And that's where I was thinking that it would be fun to take electric Bastionland's Borough creation (or the other types of maps) and make it a communal thing. I've attempted making it communal in the beginning of this year with the kids, but using end of class time is a bit short, so that failed. But with this I can revisit it. Everyone could take turns adding routes, choosing the type of road it is, etc. Besides that, keep the two aspects for the game itself: Current Issues and Impending Issues. These can fuel and/or be fueled by whatever is created already, be it faces and places or something like that.
The Faces and Places from Fate create instant NPC's to place on the map (if they are on the map) or to tie to the greater world. The Spark Tables and the Backgrounds of Electric Bastionland cans till be rolled on or used as inspiration for creating our starting situation.
I don't know if this is a thing that I will have time to test out anytime soon, but I hope to try it out soon-ish.]]></summary>

There's a perverse tragic hilarity to the story, most of the characters are often fairly awful people but are nonetheless entertaining. The whole thing meanders about, speeding up in places and rushing along before cooling and wandering once more. This varied between enjoyable and annoying for me, depending on how I felt about the particular chapter.


Milady is perhaps the best character, she radiates palpable fury, the first time we actually get a close look at her and hear her speak in the text she dashes a fan to pieces in rage. I'm not sure if an…]]></summary>

I utilize this all the time in general handwave fashion, but when I specifically run Into the Odd/Weird North/Cairn/Monolith etc, I've landed on a three-tier measure of NPC power so as to better represent varying tactical levels of possible encounters. It's not rocket science, and it's not perfect, but it's what I do and it's been nigh-on effortless for me for years now. 
There are three NPC statlines, and that's it. Ever.

This, I feel, is the best way to deal with worldbuilding in tRPGs. Rather than fight against the given fact that people will alter your work based on the preferences and needs of their tables, you can learn to embrace it and actively make settings that do not have a canon, or at least very little canon. There are a number of ways I have seen folks embrace this idea: from sharing unfinished projects and incomplete thoughts to publishing material that deliberately leaves gaps that need to be filled in during prep or at the table. 

Luka Rejec is the one I found that first called this sort of writing anti-canon, but Chris McDowall makes references to similar thoughts (and I consider Electric Bastionland to be the pinacle of this sort of anti-canon worldbuilding), and Arno…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The idea is loosely inspired by Vampire Hunter D, specifically Volume 5. What is an undead dream? This post was originally drafted in like 2019 and I was never sure what to do with it. I've had some similar ideas lately, I intend to explore some version of this further in the near future.



They say that when you die, your brain floods with DMT, the chemical of dreams. Your perception of time slows and you relive your life as synapses die and memories pop into being one last time. Memories are fuzzy and imperfect things, and in your psychedelic dreamscape your life plays out a little bit differently. Then, your dreamscape self dies, and it floods with DMT, and so recursively, at the moment of your death, you dream and live your entire multiverse of selves.
These recursive multiversal selves exist in a metaphysical space, a space of souls, where the soul-self opens the gate of the pineal gland and enters the collective unconscious.
And what are undead, if not liminal beings, a physical, synaptic consciousness at the gate, lacking a soul, the apparatus to join the collective unconscious? Zombies don't hunger for brains, they hunger for souls. But no matter how hard they try, no matter how many brains they consume, they'll never be able to digest, to integrate, the soul. Weep for the pitiful hungry zombie. Vampires, lich lords, and other intelligent undead sleep, but without a soul, what do they dream?
They do not relive their lives, but the lives of those whose brains they've eaten, blood they've drank, bodies they've necromantically revived; damaged and mutated, the undigested souls linger within, propagating through a dark multiverse of astral un-life, the reciprocation of undeath, a limbo dimension of null that exists, cruelly, to balance the physical inequality of energy that undeath introduces into the universe. The undead dream the purgatory of the living.




Also, I made my first post on the collaborative blog Iconoclastic Flow!

Almost every day I am confronted with an annoying fact: I have more interests than I have time for. Add a job and a relationship to this and I have not nearly enough time to do all the things that interest me. In short: there is little time for me to run and prep tRPGs. 

This has made me obsessed with efficiency, both when running games as well as when I design tRPG stuff. On the design end of things, Chris McDowall's minimalism has been really influential in this and his work is something I consider the gold standard to aim for myself. But it turns out that when running games I am already quite efficient with my time.

Through surveying my players for the FLOK playtest I learned that all of them seemed in agreement that I run my games fast. To give an example: I r…]]></summary>

My blog output has been slow this year. Partially this is because I've started several very long posts that are each taking a while to finish, but mostly it's because I spend most of my time working now and have very little time left each day to do anything. I wanted to come up with something a bit smaller that could work as a good blog post to get out before the end of the month that isn't one of those huge posts, but I struggled. Everything I came up with was too small. So why not just offer all of them at once?
In this post you'll find seven really small RPG-related things I'd like to share which are all completely unrelated to one another. I hope the comments are chaos. They include:

Screwhead being of the Was it Likely blog, who was doing brilliant FKR-ish stuff before FKR was even a thing.


I've interviewed all of these bloggers before (see interview tag) and Devil Devil Devil is genuinely one of the most interest RPGs I've read in a while. The other friends of Screwhead I've also been getting to know a bit and they all seem cool as well.


I've got one bog post there already drafted, but since Screwhead was the lead organizer, we felt he should be the one to kick things off, with:



Lords of Old; a GMless Competitive Social Deduction TTRPG of Gods in the Ruins of the Old World





Given how much I've bounced around on this blog between worldbuilding, game discussion, prose, game mechanics, coding stuff, interviews, weird experimental stuff like Weird & Wonderful Wavelengths, etc., I don't necessarily have a coherent idea of what will differentiate my posts there vs. here, and there may in fact not be any meaningful differentiation, it'll just be another place to read my stuff, so if you're already enjoying this blog, or any of the other creators involved in this collaboration, check it out.]]></summary>

I've talked to many people who think that combat in 5E isn’t really fun. There are many arguments for this, some of which are perfectly valid and some of which just come down to subjectivity, but by far the most common argument is this: they say that because it removed so many mechanical elements from the process (e.g. flanking mechanics, using miniatures and grids by default, having to take fe…]]></summary>

 Kind of a contemporary counterpart to my Random Impedimenta. Might also be useful for post-apocalyptic games or ones set in slightly older historical periods, as there is a whiff of anachronism in some of these. These days most of my tables are geared toward Fantasy, but even in that context I’ll admit to sometimes sprinkling in the occasional item from this as an intriguing/puzzling out-of-place artifact or a teaspoon dosage of gonzo.

I started up a new local Galaxy Far Away campaign just over a week ago, and I realized I did not take a liking to the standard opposed 2d6 resolution that I originally penned for the game. Maybe it's because using d6 in Star Wars should belong with West End Games' timeless take on the genre, or maybe because I tend to find traditional opposed resolution less and less compelling these days. 
I have grown stale on finding out if something happens or not. Instead, stuff always happens. The question is not "does it happen?" but "how?" and I'm finding that said qualitative result generation is much more interesting than pass/fail.

Not all sorceries need be showy ones, and the wonder these sorts of “special effects” can evoke can sometimes add more than they subtract from play if we are just a little scrupulous in how they function.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday it was pointed out to me that I had been remiss with providing a Random Table for generating Mushrooms/Toadstools, which is indeed a tragedy considering how fond I am of sprinkling “fun” fungi as Resources and Hazards within my Wilderness Adventures. So, I aimed to rectify this oversight post-haste by moving this Table to the top of the dev pile (where in all fairness, it sprouted with almost uncanny swiftness).
 These can be used in conjunction with my venerable Herb & Plant Generator, and although the Name-stems are intended to be used to generate new and unusual Local Common Names, you can just as easily read across if swiftness is required and treat this more like a standard d100 table. I often like a quick name for flavoring Foraging Results as “You found some Edible Mushrooms” is just so frightfully bland.
 Use your best judgement to determine an appropriate randomizer if you find yourself in need of a “Number Appearing” (I'm rather fond of 2d6 with "Doubles Add and Roll Again" most of the time, but you could also randomize the die type to use with a quick d8: d4 through d100.) I prefer to heavily festoon some places in evocative fungi as a mood-enhancer, but a few of these are probably best when more precious and significantly rarer. If not expressly edible, and you find yourself in need of a nastier consequence for the foolhardy consumer, there is always my Terrible Toxins & Vile Venoms Table as well.]]></summary>
