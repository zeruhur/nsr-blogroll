                              <span>The Idea

  
I often see a rules light game complimented by saying its rules, &quot;get out of the way&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t slow things down&quot; during play. Whereas I also see (usually different people) say that rules light games are too ephemeral, or there&#x27;s not enough &quot;meat&quot; there.
I&#x27;ve had the thought that both of these statements are actually talking about the same thing.

Mechanics in a TTRPG provide friction. They slow things down, and they provide grip. 
When you encounter a situation that requires interfacing with mechanics, that often means pausing the narration, consulting the rules (depending on complexity), and rolling dice before you can continue.
This can be bad, if it interrupts an otherwise good flow of conversation and narration. But it can also be good, if it provides a slight pause at th…</span>

Though they’re not nearly as represented in the standard treasure lists as other garments (outside the occasional pair providing Ogre Power). Be it Glove or Gauntlet, rather than just applying a Magical bonus or malus, like most Magical Treasures, I often prefer them to serve as creative solutions to potential problems the players may face.

                              <span>The players in my game will be going through a secret passageway to the keep, hoping to gain access unnoticed. What they do not know is that someone in the new management of the keep has found it as well, being the curious wizard-type that he is, and installed a magic door to keep it safe. His magic wasn&#x27;t entirely successful though, not he knows this, and this door gained a personality that can be played into to convince it to be opened up to the players. This is how The Door At The End&#x27;s magical protection looks like.



A bas relief in Mechelen city that we found yesterday and took a picture of.


The Door At The End (of the secret tunnel)

At the end of the tunnel you find a door to the Keep&#x27;s fountain. On the door is a bas relief of a lion with a ring in it&#x27;s mouth through which some tassled ribbons are draped.
When you try to open it in any way, it will come alive and talk, unclearly as if the ring in its mouth is actually obstructing it.
1. Hewwo phewe. How are you phoing?
2. Ohohohhoho! Phtoooop! Phah Tickwleph!
3. Exphcuuphe me? Phwho awe you?
4. Unhand me at oneph! Phavageph!
5. Aaauw! PHTOP IT!
6. *eye roll* Wha&#x27; awe you doim?
It is recently installed and enchanted by Orion the Advisor, who found the passages. It can only allow those with the right key, but there is a flaw in it&#x27;s design in that it has a bit of a personality, and it often feels lonely here. 
It might open for you if you...
1. Tell him a story. Either one he hasn&#x27;t heard before, or a specific one that is his favorite.
2. Sing him a song. Either one he hasn&#x27;t heard before, or a specific one that is his favorite.
3. Talk to him about the outside world. He wants to experience it through you. Does it line up with what he has heard before? How does this influence his decision on wether or not to open for you?
4. Teach him a sentence in a new language.
5. Make him pretty somehow. Paint, flowers, a ribbon ... Bonus if you can show him in a mirror.
6. Show him a dance, trick or other visual performance.</span>

                              <span>So you found a secret passage to the Keep
My adventurers know of a secret way into the Keep. Since due to recent events they feel they can not really trust people in the Keep with the evidence they are currently bringing into the Keep they decide to take this way into the Keep.
I found a certain map of cave systems where they will find the entrance to this secret passage. Following the passage should be interesting I feel, so I made an encounter table.

 So, I&#x27;ve been taking some players through B2 - Keep on the Borderlands through play-by-post gaming. We use Discord for this and I&#x27;m constantly learning how to do this better. There have been two &quot;sessions&quot; this far, which I kind of classify as a separate excursion. Our playing mainly depends on me having the time and state of mind to run it, which means that it&#x27;s usually a school vacation thing. We&#x27;re also in quite different time zones, which makes it slower than it might otherwise be, but I&#x27;ve got nothing to complain about. The pace is right for me, going from about two posts a day to one every other day moves things about quickly enough to still feel like we&#x27;re getting things done. The system we use is Maze Rats, which makes things go rather smoothly. Anyway…</span>

                              <span>As I said in my previous post, I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of kung fu movies. A core feature of these movies is a training scene. The hero goes from nursing their bruised knuckles to smashing through stone walls. Importantly, there are frequently multiple training scenes. 36 Chambers of Shaolin is essentially one long training scene sequence.
Because training scenes are an important part of the genre, they seem important to gameify. Saying &quot;Okay, you go off and train for a few months and we&#x27;re back&quot; seems insufficient. 
But how can you make doing 100 pushups, reciting 100 sutras, or carrying 100 jugs of water interesting?

Some say the ancient blanket of buried salt keeps what shouldn&#x27;t be out of the woods. Others say it subtly whispers to the Old Things, inviting them to the gullies and high places across West Virginia.
Down south of Charleston, past where the Kanawha River branches off into the trickle of Loop Creek, are the deep woods cramped-in around nowhere towns like Kinkaid and Artie. This was wild land even before I-64 was abandoned and fell apart under the forest canopy, and now it&#x27;s all but primeval landscape, peppered with cabins and hunters and things best left alone.

HP: 8 // ARMOR: 6 // SPELL SLOTS: 2 DEX +1 // WIL +2
Orion Romatet is the delicate, nine-fingered advisor to the Castellan.



Study Head of a Woman
Anthonis van Dyck

Orion Romatet is known to: 
• Be the personal Advisor to the Castellan.
 • Have only nine fingers. 
• Have a strong fashion sense.


Orion Romatet is rumored to:
• Actually be girl, disguised as a man so as to be able to be around the Castellan. Scandalous!
• Have sold his finger to the devil for dark, magical power. Why does he get away with this?
• Actually be a fairy prince, tagging along with the Castellan to see if a possible alliance would be a good idea.


Orion Romatet will ask you:
 • What your Zodiac Sign is.
• What strange things you have seen.
• Wether you could bring back something strange next time, preferably alive.


Gear:
Magical Plate Mail:
• +2 Armor
• no advantage on DEX Danger Rolls or Surprise Attack Rolls.
• Orichalcum armor inscribed with illusion runes, giving it the look of pretty, regular clothes.
Ring of the Phoenix:
• A ring holding a single feather from a phoenix’s tail. This gives free access to the word FIRE or LIFE for use in spells, wether or not the winds of magic or the pre-ordained position of the heavenly bodies would dictate it so. You can only choose one of the two words. You cannot use them both at once.
Short Bow:
• 2 handed weapon for shooting ranged arrows.
Magical Arrows (10): 
 • Contain their own spell slot each.
• One of the words is already set by the rune carved in the arrowhead (SHOOT/SHOOTING) the other depends on the winds of magic and a user of magic to fill in.</span>

I decided to write this because in the last two weeks, I&#x27;ve seen at least 4 Reddit posts and a couple Discord messages where people asked that very question, and I get tired of explaining it. So if you see someone asking that question, link them to this article.



Outline

West End Games Star Wars (1987), AKA &quot;Star Wars d6.&quot; This is the &quot;old school&quot; option and uses big pools of d6s for everything.
Wizards of the Coast Star Wars (2000), AKA &quot;Star Wars d20,&quot; which was revised in 2002 and…</span>

There was a lot that went into that and a lot that led up to that, but let&#x27;s leave it at this: it was something I&#x27;d always wanted to do, and getting emotional and writing nerd shit remains something I want to pour myself into for a lot more years.
(The next few paragraphs are some more weepy personal blather because apparently this blog also doubles as therapy for me, so feel free to skip down to the title below. TL;DR: here&#x27;s a project I&#x27;ve been toying with and plan to start working on in earnest.)

 “Jupiter, king of the Roman gods, is said to have given the honeybee his stinger, to protect his honey. His wife, Juno, however, insisted there must be payment for this gift of a weapon, so Jupiter gave the stinger with the condition that the bee dies should she use it.”

Bees the size of loaves of bread are sometimes spotted around the borderlands. But where do they come from? Where do they find the nectar for their honey?
Where do they come from?
1. Deep underground, where there are giant caves full of giant animals and plants. 
They are lost and confused. This upsets them greatly. A system of caves must be close by that leads to these strange lands. Their honey has natural healin…</span>

This is a dangerous thing to do, and we&#x27;re playing Maze Rats, so make a Danger Roll! 
If there&#x27;s any reason for you gaining advantage or adding a stat bonus, argue for it now.
Whether or not you succeed, an encounter will be had. The result of your danger roll just decides how well your encounter will go.

After the Danger Roll has been rolled, the GM also rolls 2d6, basing the encounter table on this blogpost by Papers and Pencils, adding, consequently a dragon and a wizard (or in this case, witch) to the module.

I may want to do a bigger FIST post down the line, or maybe a micro-setting using FIST as the core system, but in the mean time, here is my attempt at a few premade characters randomly generated:

HP: 3, ARMOR 6, ATT+1


Wolves in the Borderlands are common. They roam the forests in packs. While the North American wolves might be known to be afraid of humans in general, the European wolves are bigger and meaner than that and have been known to attack humans when hungry. 


In the Borderlands, the strange and chaotic forces that permeate this area sometimes changes things about the wolves and make them strange.


The chance of this alteration occurring will depend on how much of a foothold chaos has on the lands. I suggest starting with a 1/6 chance, triggering on a 6, adding +1 to each time ‘regular’ wolves are rolled. And add a +1 for each rank of a foothold Chaos has on the lands.






The Eurasian Grey Wolf, found free to use on Wikipedia



The Wolves of the Borderland might…
1. Talk and understand humans. They know to use this to attract prey.
2. Leave ashen paw prints that remain warm to the touch for a night and a day.
3. Have a howl that makes you think your feet suddenly sink into the ground and are stuck.  
Roll DANGER +WIL or be paralyzed with fear for a round.
4. Have the ability to grow to the size of cows.
Double HP, +1 to ATTACK
5. Be ridden by kobolds wanting to cause mischief of the deadly kind. 
They will use their own devious skills to make fighting harder, like riding with a line of rope between them to try and trip up people, shooting arrows that might paralyze or put you to sleep, etc.
6. Have the ability to breathe a cloud of mist, making ranged attacks on them harder, forcing people to have to go hand to hand, or to make it easier for them to flee.</span>

I&#x27;ve been watching Shaw Brothers films at the gym this summer. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar, Shaw Brothers was a prolific Hong Kong production company that produced grindhouse kung fu films. Basically, all the audio samples from Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) were from these films. 
&gt; Frog style is incredibly strong and immune to nearly any weapon.
I like some of the films more than I like others, but almost all of them have something that made me say &quot;Ha ha neat.&quot; Almost all of them have something gameable. 
In this post, I&#x27;m going to step through the Shaw Brothers&#x27; film Clan of the White Lotus beat by beat. Heavy spoilers warning, obviously. …</span>

Mother to goblins and hobgoblins


Trying to find a source for this picture led me to a deactivated Tumblr for Cultur Tava.



HP:4 // ARMOR 6* (impervious to physical harm until a certain protection is dealt with)
SPELL SLOTS: 5 // Special Item: Cursing Charm


It is said that the witch Magobia cannot have children of her own and that because of that she resolved to steal babies for her own. 
• Some say that it’s because she’s barren, some say that it’s because she’s too mean for anyone to want a relationship with her.  
• Rumor goes that her desire for children has led her to kidnapping them and feeding them her special witch-food, turning them into goblins and hobgoblins in the process. 
 • She is followed around by what looks like a black cat that has the power,…</span>

Setup
Before you start exploring the Ages, establish the basics of your setting.
First agree on the tone of your world. Is it an eerie lonely experience? Or are the ages still bustling with life? Decide with your group and note down a couple of adjectives.
Create a foundational age and a device (following their respective instructions in the next chapter). Describe why this age serves as a crossroads to other ages. Name this age.

Gros Jean: Ogre of the woods
HP:12, ARMOR:8, +2AB, STR+2, Ogre Great-Club (2-handed, Ogre Sized, +1DMG), Wearing treated bearskin as armour (+1ARM, already calculated)


Gros Jean is the ogre that roams these parts of the country. He mainly works as a mercenary for the forces of Chaos. He recently has come in possession of an unholy symbol of the dark forces, that will slowly corrupt his mind, offering him dark powers. Gros Jean has an agreement with the Witch Magobia that if the goblins pay him, he will protect them, as he can have some of the babies she brings in as food.


When Gros Jean is met in the wild he…
 1. Is eating and will tolerate weary travelers to join. 
2. Is admiring his ruby necklace of the Snake.
 3. Has a manacled prisoner on a chain and is sitting down with a pensive smile brainstorming on an apt punishment for the oath the prisoner broke. 
4. Is very hungry and looking for food. You look tasty. Or do you perhaps have a baby?
 5. Is grumpy and angry because his prisoner escaped. 
6. Is hanging chains with stone skulls on them on a prisoner. One for each of the men he promised to bring back safely, but failed to do so. He has to cary these around wherever they go.


Ogres are descendants of the old Roman deity called Orcus. They roam the world, eating babies (preferably) and enjoying in punishing oath-breakers. 


There are more ogres in the land, but not a lot. They do not get along very much and as such remain a good distance away from each other. If they get too close to each other, the land cannot sustain their appetite all that much and they will fight over food. Sometimes an ogre will find a mate though, and somehow they manage to tolerate each other. Woe betide the lands where this is the case.</span>

Put some of these traps into your dungeons. Use them as inspiration to create your own.
 I. Mysterious Tower, Acid Lake
 There is a tumbledown tower on the middle of an island. The island is in the middle of a bright-green acid lake. The lake is death for whoever falls into it.
 Why this trap doesn’t suck: The possible rewards are tantalizing. (A mysterious tower? What’s in it?) The dangers are obvious. (The lake is bright green! Acid is deadly!) This is an open-ended problem with many pos…</span>

Hobgoblins: 
HP: 4 // ARMOR 6
Hobgoblins were once children who showed a definite mean streak in their nature. The Witch Magobia lured them away from home with many promises, and fed them her special food, disguised as gingerbread cakes. Eventually her corruption deformed them as well. 
The following are all true: 
• Once the gingerbread is eaten, they can no longer get sustenance from any other food. They need her food to survive. This is how she controls them.
 • These children grow up looking like very wrinkly teenagers in much the same way as the babies turn into goblins. Their skin-tone remains closer to their original one, if not a bit less vibrant.
• The hobgoblins are cruel and have less of a need to be fearful, compared to the go…</span>

Goblins: 
HP: 2 // ARMOR 6
stats for Maze Rats


It is true that Goblins were children stolen from their crib and turned into goblins by the Witch Magobia. The following is also true about them:
• They never grow bigger than a toddler, as their growth is stunted by their strange diet.
• Their skin gets an unhealthy grey and wrinkles as if they are of very old age. Their pupils turn a very pale-pink color and their hair a greasy black.
 • Most grow up to be mean, fearful and craven.


When encountering Goblins in the wild they… 
• Try to hide or run away if you are stronger than them. 
• Are singing a dreadful song that teaches to be mean.

In this post I wanted to talk about using objects and locations in RPGs to tell a history or fiction. I believe we already use environmental storytelling in our games, however I wanted to delve deeper—understand how we can consciously apply this concept to our settings.
Motivation
The OSR play culture is particularly interested in exploring fantastical locations. Lots of focus is put into creating these spaces that the referee describes to the players. In turn, the players are expected to interact in these spaces as much as possible. Players usually explore ruins or derelicts of some kind, so the objects within them will always have a history.

The 2nd Age 

The 2nd Age is a tabletop RPG supplement containing 12 institutions intended to supplant traditional classes for games that prefer a more materialist approach to advancement. 
When using these institutions, power is gained primarily as a reward for your service to the empire of Turandor through one of its institutions. However, once you join one of these organisations, they decide what you do and where you go. Those who serve their institution will advance through its ranks and …</span>

I don&#x27;t know how well this will translate to a PR, despite my efforts to make these PRs more interesting.


I was inspired by the Scales of Conviction system for the videogame Triangle Strategy, where key plot events are decided on a vote, and the player has to talk to the various NPCs and gather information to try to sway the votes of the rest of the party. I figured that would work even better in a TTRPG, and it did. At some point either here or on Iconoclastic Flo…</span>

                              <span>A short post explaining why I think spaceships with wings can work in a hard sci-fi setting. And I will not be talking about landings here, since wings aren’t crucial for that. Instead I will introduce you to the concept of aerogravity assist.
Not to be confused with aerobreaking, which is a manoeuvre that uses the atmosphere of a planet to slow down a spacecraft. Aerogravity assist uses the atmosphere to speed up instead.
A common manoeuvre in space travel is the gravity assist—using a planets gravity well as a slingshot to deflect your trajectory. The closer you get to the planet, the more your course will be changed. The issue is that you are limited by the planets atmosphere. If you come too close, the drag will significantly reduce your speed and the costs will outweigh the benefits.

                              <span>This is an old draft, way before I decided to start using Concept Crafting for Mecha Gear. I think in all likelihood it&#x27;s too fiddly, and I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with it even at the time, but it&#x27;s interesting seeing how it got me to where it is now.




This is for my Into the Odd Mecha Hack: Get Into the Machine, Shinji! The mechanics have changed to varying degrees since I&#x27;ve been running my MRD2 Campaign, but this post more so corresponds to the original GitMS! than to MRD2. Most notably, it is no longer the case in MRD2 that Golem (the Mecha) have their own Ability Scores anymore, instead just sharing the pilot Ability Scores, but having their own Damage dice and of course the Gear.

                              <span>Locked Doors or Containers are a time-honored obstacle to exploration and discovery. They present an opportunity for the clever Thief to fiddle with their tools to flex their percentiles, the Fighter to muscle things open with a sturdy d6, or the Magic User to unleash a mighty Knock. If only there were another way?
 The presence of a Lock implies the existence of a Key. Here are a Hundred places where that pesky unlocker might live. Much like my previous posts on Secret or Stuck Doors, some imply a puzzle or a skosh of Set Dressing as well. Some of the particularly tricky ones might be worthy of rewarding the Players with a passe-partout.</span>
