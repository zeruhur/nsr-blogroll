This, right here, is one of my all-time favorite board games, packed so full of chrome and drama that you can rewrite the Original Trilogy with a single play. This is not a post, however, about the board game, nor the similarly-styled and eponymous computer strategy game which came before it.

                              <span>WotC just dropped news that they&#x27;ll be bringing back the AD+D 2e settings of Spelljammer and Dragonlance. You can read all about that over at EnWorld if you&#x27;re so inclined. 
I never got into Spelljammer -- I missed a chance to pick up some of the old boxed sets for literal pennies, and I still kick myself for it -- but the concept still holds loads of intrinsic appeal to me. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve seen a satisfying treatment of naval play in a D+D framework yet, and I&#x27;m curious to see how WotC approaches it. (I suspect that their approach to voyages and space probably won&#x27;t be one that quite scratches the yearnings I have, but seeing how they tackle it certainly isn&#x27;t a bad thing.) 
But Dragonlance? Dragonlance was one of my main entrypoints into D+D. I started off with the superlative Ret…</span>

                              <span>I am involved in a collaborative blog! See the description from Screwhead&#x27;s tweet below:


Iconoclastic Flow is a collaborative blog, with content from Max of Weird and Wonderful Worlds, Semiurge of Archons March On, Spwack of Slight Adjustments, Sibylla of  Devil Devil Devil, and Sofinho of Alone in the Labyrinth, as well as 4 lovely creatives from my real life!


Screwhead being of the Was it Likely blog, who was doing brilliant FKR-ish stuff before FKR was even a thing.


I&#x27;ve interviewed all of these bloggers before (see interview tag) and Devil Devil Devil is genuinely one of the most interest RPGs I&#x27;ve read in a while. The other friends of Screwhead I&#x27;ve also been getting to know a bit and they all seem cool as well.


I&#x27;ve got one bog post there already drafted, but since Screwhead was the lead organizer, we felt he should be the one to kick things off, with:



Lords of Old; a GMless Competitive Social Deduction TTRPG of Gods in the Ruins of the Old World





Given how much I&#x27;ve bounced around on this blog between worldbuilding, game discussion, prose, game mechanics, coding stuff, interviews, weird experimental stuff like Weird &amp; Wonderful Wavelengths, etc., I don&#x27;t necessarily have a coherent idea of what will differentiate my posts there vs. here, and there may in fact not be any meaningful differentiation, it&#x27;ll just be another place to read my stuff, so if you&#x27;re already enjoying this blog, or any of the other creators involved in this collaboration, check it out.</span>

This was inspired by a recent claim I made that there&#x27;s such a thing as &quot;system-agnostic combat encounter design&quot; that you can and should learn, which many people were resistant to. Here was the original pitch I wrote for this:


I&#x27;ve talked to many people who think that combat in 5E isn’t really fun. There are many arguments for this, some of which are perfectly valid and some of which just come down to subjectivity, but by far the most common argument is this: they say that because it removed so many mechanical elements from the process (e.g. flanking mechanics, using miniatures and grids by default, having to take fe…</span>

 Kind of a contemporary counterpart to my Random Impedimenta. Might also be useful for post-apocalyptic games or ones set in slightly older historical periods, as there is a whiff of anachronism in some of these. These days most of my tables are geared toward Fantasy, but even in that context I’ll admit to sometimes sprinkling in the occasional item from this as an intriguing/puzzling out-of-place artifact or a teaspoon dosage of gonzo. I always endeavor to render the trinket via a description rather than name it though in these situations 😊</span>

I started up a new local Galaxy Far Away campaign just over a week ago, and I realized I did not take a liking to the standard opposed 2d6 resolution that I originally penned for the game.

I have grown stale on finding out if something happens or not. Instead, stuff always happens. The question is not &quot;does it happen?&quot; but &quot;how?&quot; and I&#x27;m finding that said qualitative result generation is much more interesting than pass/fail. I&#x27;m not reinventing the wheel here, as the whole &quot;yes, and&quot; or &quot;yes, but&quot; …</span>

                              <span>Now and again, I come across Referees considering Cantrips as a way of adding a little bit more Magic to their Spellcasters. These are a sometimes-contentious subject because some implementations result in these abilities interfering with or obviating interesting parts of play such as Resource Management. Another common issue sometimes has to do more with Setting conceits, and how they can sometimes transmogrify something treasured or rare into a thing much more mundane or humdrum.
   
But take heart! Not all sorceries need be showy ones, and the wonder these sorts of “special effects” can evoke can sometimes add more than they subtract from play if we are just a little scrupulous in how they function.

                              <span>Yesterday it was pointed out to me that I had been remiss with providing a Random Table for generating Mushrooms/Toadstools, which is indeed a tragedy considering how fond I am of sprinkling “fun” fungi as Resources and Hazards within my Wilderness Adventures. So, I aimed to rectify this oversight post-haste by moving this Table to the top of the dev pile (where in all fairness, it sprouted with almost uncanny swiftness).
 These can be used in conjunction with my venerable Herb &amp; Plant Generator, and although the Name-stems are intended to be used to generate new and unusual Local Common Names, you can just as easily read across if swiftness is required and treat this more like a standard d100 table. I often like a quick name for flavoring Foraging Results as “You found some Edible Mushrooms” is just so frightfully bland.
 Use your best judgement to determine an appropriate randomizer if you find yourself in need of a “Number Appearing” (I&#x27;m rather fond of 2d6 with &quot;Doubles Add and Roll Again&quot; most of the time, but you could also randomize the die type to use with a quick d8: d4 through d100.) I prefer to heavily festoon some places in evocative fungi as a mood-enhancer, but a few of these are probably best when more precious and significantly rarer. If not expressly edible, and you find yourself in need of a nastier consequence for the foolhardy consumer, there is always my Terrible Toxins &amp; Vile Venoms Table as well.</span>

So your mice have suddenly come to power in a local settlement? Have they been granted rule by a noblemice? Have organised a clever coup? Well, now they have new problems of managing a township. This post is written to guide you through this tricky process.
township turn
When mice perform town managing duties, time is divided into township turns, which last about a week. At the start of each township turn, roll a district die which will inform what happens on that turn.

1
Encounter
New characters arrive to the settlement. A merchant caravan, an attack by evil cats, or humans start meddling with the tree you dwell under.


2
Ruin
Buildings and structures age and/or get damaged.

                              <span>Since last year I was toying myself with the idea to write a setting inspired by Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Hayao Miyazaki’s masterpiece. The first attempt was last year to submit for InPlay #3 (then never issued, alas), but I was not able to meet the deadline.
The idea stuck in my mind, for merrier times. Then other project came, fatherhood and everything connected to it.
Until Yochai Gal launched the *Forest of Another Name” Cairn Jam last month. The original deadline was March 31st and I know it was totally impossible for me to meet that deadline. Then it has postponed to April 15th and I was able to start writing my submission in time.
The result is Taintedweald, a mini-setting in a 24 pages zine. Let’s see it in detail!
The title is a portmanteau because they sounds good and …</span>

                              <span>Growing up around Horses, how I use them in these games might be one of my vernacular tells. One of those little things that I always seem to do, despite what the system might say. When I was younger, I had the privilege of spending some of my Summers with these animals, grooming, riding, but mostly I remember mucking out intolerably mephitic and sweltering Stables for extra pocket money (some of which even went to Roleplaying Game Books!).
Horses can be incredibly frustrating and thick-headed creatures, or remarkably patient and even helpful. Some are tender and kind, others are just plain mean to anything that walks on two feet or four. Getting to gradually know them over time, you soon learn little peculiarities and peccadillos that might not be obvious at first glance. Each one ends up…</span>

I&#x27;ve played in or run a handful of &gt;1yr long campaigns so far, and this is only the second to come to a proper conclusion, and the first to do so satisfactorily. This campaign truly lived up to the ideals of what I had intended MRD to be, and did so in a way that I had not anticipated, driven by the actions of the Players and the decisions they made given the conceits I presented to them. We&#x27;ll be following up with a new campaign where one of the Players will take over as GM with their own modified take on MRD, and I&#x27;ll be running an MRD2 campaign with a new group IRL, but this feels like a milestone in the jou…</span>

We take it for granted that we have two average human hands. You can eat a sandwich, fold your clothes, and stare at your smartphone for much more time than is necessary with typical hands. Take those away, and you get all sorts of curious different conceptions of everyday ambulation and motor control. 
So what do you do without hands? Are you like Zacian, from Generation VIII Pokemon, who is a superpowered dog that holds a straight-up legendary sword in its mouth? That is, admittedly, quite rad.

 Oftentimes I like to encourage any Magic-Users to tailor the appearance of their dweomers a bit: Customizing them by Caster for a little individuality. I often find myself doing this for Foes to keep the other players on their toes as well. The rather generic description of the Shield Spell is one that I felt could use a little sprucing now-and-then. Invisible fields of force might still function of course, but it seems like a missed opportunity to make that Magic less monotonous and a little more Magical. 😊
 Here are a hundred ideas for dressing up those defensive spells. This is solely intended to serve as a dollop of fluff and flavor of course...Unless?</span>

                              <span>Here is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek diversion from what might be considered slightly more useful Random Tables. It has always been extremely interesting to me how the standard Equipment lists in these games do so much heavy lifting to telegraph Setting, and I often tend to see players new to the game gravitate to a few of the same things.
 Allium sativum on the list alongside other, perhaps more practical, purchases for Dungeon Delving is one of these. Its mere presence seems to scream to some that the possibility of Vampires is not only very real, but something they ought to prepare for. The same way those lovely Saving Throw Categories, so starkly listed on their sheet, stoically advertise other dangers.
 But what may have gone unnoticed is just how pricey that lovely little Bulb can be. A little casual research reveals that it tends to stay remarkably stable pricewise in these older games. Naturally, this led me to wonder Why?
 So, here is a table of a Hundred ways to address this burning question (admittedly over-contemplated on my part) and these weird implications. It just goes to show that there are all sorts of lovely little nuances living in those lists that are hiding and waiting to be revealed by Referee’s with perhaps too much time on their hands.😂</span>

                              <span>I’ve come up with what I think is an interesting and useful way of thinking about RPGs, but the seeds of it were planted in my head by an unlikely source.
I was watching this GDC talk by Mick Gordon about how he created the music for Doom (2016). In it, he describes how his main instrument for the game was a simple sine wave — what he describes as the purest form of sound — filtered through four channels of machines that distort the “pure” sound into something industrial, noisy, and full of character.
In a previous post, I described all RPGs as the product of different kinds of “creative constraints” upon play-pretend, which you might call the “purest form” of RPG. I listed various kinds of constraints, but this GDC talk made me think — what if I reorganized those constraints into four cha…</span>

                              <span>Yet another table that had been languishing on the dev pile for far too long! Here we have One Hundred Magical Mishaps or Calamitous Curses to inflict upon the table. Since some games don’t have a “Roll To Cast” system in place, these could also be repurposed for all manner of other unfortunate Eldritch Events. Potion Miscibility is popular, but they may also prove useful for Failed Experiments, Scrambled Scrolls, or Grimoires Protected from Prying Eyes. Some of them make mighty fine Horrible Hexes as well, much more memorable and meaningful than a mechanical malus (that players have a remarkable tendency to conveniently forget to apply!)
 Grafting on additional risk to Spell Casting is something I’ve done in the past. However, I feel it works a bit better if it’s accompanied by a correspondingly tempting reward. One that I particularly enjoyed was allowing a thrill-seeking Magic User to choose to roll a Saving Throw versus Spells after Casting, on a success the Spell is retained and they may cast it again. On a failure, the Spell is lost as with normal Vancian magics. On a 1, a Magical Mishap occurs. One can tweak the frequency of these fantastic failures to taste, or potentially even penalize the Save by the level of the Spell or number of prior retentions attempts in a given time-period. When Magic becomes predictable and repeatable, it can sometimes veer toward banality, so this at least tries to maintain a bit of that delicious wonder should one go down this route.    
A small amount of effort was put into “tuning” this table a bit, so that smaller die sizes have less “consequential” impacts, so feel free to escalate these however you see fit. What happens with a d6 should be a little less severe than something rolled higher on a d30, with the more disastrous consequences generally occurring only on upper ends of the d100. Durations are occasionally included, but feel free to season those to taste, and as with all misfortunes some just might be possible to undo through additional Adventure.</span>

I basically just stripped down how Worlds Without Number does ability checks and simplified attacking to one roll. The non-standard attributes, combat order, and Difficult Movement rules come from my big WIP, Goblets &amp; Grues.
I might try using this to run OSE adventures and the like, who knows.

Naturally, one should assume that any standard effects and procedures associated with being doused in Dragon Breath should apply. These are merely adjuncts.

Mecha are sometimes described as being a metaphor for the body- which makes sense, they are humanoid giant robots, often unnecessarily anthropomorphized, and often used to tell stories about the adolescent experience or the brutality of war. I don&#x27;t mean to suggest this is all that Mecha entail, but this alone can be explored in ways that I have rarely if ever seen.

                              <span>So on the 2nd of April there was a little gaming day organized in Antwerp. Antwerp is close by enough that I could easily come for one of the games. For the shift that I was in, there would be three games that would be played, an 1st Edition AD&amp;D game, a home-brew game and Starfinder. I had signed up for Starfinder. The day before I heard that Starfinder was cancelled as the GM had contracted Covid. I said that there was no problem, I would come and either join one of the other games or quickly do some kind of improv game.
I arrived, barely on time on Saturday, with some options in my backpack, which turned out to be nice, because of all the people that had said they would come, only four people were there, including the organizer. The guy running first edition needed 6 people for his game…</span>

I&#x27;ve been working for a while now on a new game. Confusingly, I&#x27;m calling it G&amp;G (Goblets &amp; Grues), which is what my failed project from over a year ago was also called.

What can I say? I really like the name. This is just a short post about a new mechanic I just added to the draft rules that I&#x27;m really excited to try out.

So, the idea of this new G&amp;G is to combine a focus on exploration and problem solving with a light emphasis on tactical combat. I miss 5E and how the differentiation of roles in combat makes every player feel important.
How to marry these two things? The two approaches seem irreconcilable...

&quot;Combat as war&quot; gameplay positions the uncertainty of combat as something to be mitigated or avoided entirely.

                              <span>An earlier version of this post was first shared on The Cauldron. I&#x27;ve fallen behind a bit and digging into my backlog, but I do have a few upcoming blog posts in mind that are more directly RPG related.






Pokemon is obviously a huge decades-long phenomenon of a franchise requiring no introduction. Yet despite this fact, I am surprised by just how little impact it has had on fiction, how little regard is paid to the fact that it is a unique science fiction or fantasy sub-genre. My intention for this post is to describe what I think makes Pokemon unique as a sub-genre, and using that as a case example for how to go about thinking about works of fiction and how they might be extrapolated into new kinds of sub-genres, which can then be explored in tabletop RPG form.

                              <span>A pipeline, hundreds of miles long, slithering across the landscape. Every creaking gasket of its many-jointed body leaks toxic sludge upon the earth. The ground churns, the plants wither, and the waters are poisoned with its passing. 


Its head is a mass of megaphones and televisions, bulldozer blades and backhoe scoops. Alternatingly chewing a path and whispering honeyed songs of &#x27;job growth&#x27; and &#x27;cheap gas&#x27; to merchants and statesmen, easing its passage. 


Minions, like melted riot police, oily black as tar, spawn from its leaking gaskets and move out in oozing phalanxes to beat back those that would stop the snakes progress. 


It will slither ever forward unless slain. Beware its children who nest in the bowls of refinery sprawl.


Big Black Snake 
10 HD, AC as plate, Save vs Churning Digging Equipment (head) or Crushing Coils (body)

Wants to slither onward, poisoning the land.
Spawns Tar Minions to protect itself.
Enlists the aid of the powerful with honeyed promises.

Tar Minions 
1 HD, AC as Ooze, 1d6 atck (club), 3d10+ appearing (work in blocks)

Like melted, oily riot police.
Unwaveringly protect the snake.
Use shield wall and encirclement tactics.
Dangerously flammable.</span>

                              <span>Deserving of their own century of entries (after this table), these marvelous Monsters hold pride of place in the very triumvirate title of the game (sharing it with Dungeons and the dreadful Ampersands). In addition to their often quite generous hoards, it seems that players always seem to gravitate towards eking every potential use out of their remains. Perhaps it’s their Inherently Magical Nature that inspires this, or mythological traditions such as Sigurd inadvertently gaining the Language of Birds whilst roasting Fafnir’s Heart in the Völsunga saga. Whatever the underlying reason, in addition to stuffing their empty sacks with all that glitters, I’m often ghoulishly quizzed on “What parts can we use, and what can they be used for?”

When I was 12, I was introduced to RPGs. I said &quot;Oh I will make one for Lord of the Rings.&quot; I went home and wrote it in a notebook. 
It was terrible. 
For the last 20 years, I have been chasing this white whale. Here is what I have learned:

Making travel fun
Alchemical subsystems
Dungeon Meshi
What IS the GLoG?
Enriching PDFs with digital tools
The current state of HIS MAJESTY THE WORM


Plus, I made this very handsome face.

One item periodically perceived as “Missing” from OSE and B/X is a quick and convenient way to instantaneously identify the functions of recovered Magical Items.
 The methods outlined within the text seem to circumscribe this process to either Experimentation or saving up to pay the exorbitant prices of Sages, Seers, and other such Specialists (a lovely money-sink in itself). The “Retainer Test Subject” approach seldom seems appealing to players, since the “Guinea Pig” often clamors to keep it (and why should they not? They assumed the risk!). Later versions, obviously informed by experiences with how these options tended to play out, mostly do away with these methods altoget…</span>

I will acknowledge that the acting is not always the best, you can tell it has a limited budget, and the writing is sometimes more corny than campy. I&#x27;m frontloading the negative, because that aside, it&#x27;s a truly creative and brilliant show and I really appreciate it for what it is.


This is superhero pastiche done right. On the surface of it, it feels very rooted in Justice League and Marvel/DC-style superhero tropes, as well as the full gamut of Watchmen, Dark Knight Returns, the 1980&#x27;s, videogames, etc. Even so, as the sum of its parts, it feels unique, and that is in large part due to …</span>

Room 9: The Banquet Area (This Is A Capital “L” Location)
If you keep going to the left of the entrance, you reach the Banquet Area. It has a great fireplace on the south wall (which the map seems to give a little crawlspace behind for no explained reason) in which the fire is still burning, but just weakly. There are many benches and tables here, of which a big throne like chair is sitting in the north, in which the leader will hold court when needed. 


This is a great place to take the adventurers if they are captured at any point. The leader likes to hold court and to flaunt his power and wealth. This could be a good place for a hearing. It would be farcical and very silly. I think I should revisit the court hearing in Alice in Wonderland f…</span>
