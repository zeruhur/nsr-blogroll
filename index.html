I decided to write this because in the last two weeks, I&#x27;ve seen at least 4 Reddit posts and a couple Discord messages where people asked that very question, and I get tired of explaining it. So if you see someone asking that question, link them to this article.

West End Games Star Wars (1987), AKA &quot;Star Wars d6.&quot; This is the &quot;old school&quot; option and uses big pools of d6s for everything.
Wizards of the Coast Star Wars (2000), AKA &quot;Star Wars d20,&quot; which was revised in 2002 and…</span>

 “Jupiter, king of the Roman gods, is said to have given the honeybee his stinger, to protect his honey. His wife, Juno, however, insisted there must be payment for this gift of a weapon, so Jupiter gave the stinger with the condition that the bee dies should she use it.”

Bees the size of loaves of bread are sometimes spotted around the borderlands. But where do they come from? Where do they find the nectar for their honey?
Where do they come from?
1. Deep underground, where there are giant caves full of giant animals and plants. 
They are lost and confused. This upsets them greatly. A system of caves must be close by that leads to these strange lands. Their honey has natural healin…</span>

This is a dangerous thing to do, and we&#x27;re playing Maze Rats, so make a Danger Roll! 
If there&#x27;s any reason for you gaining advantage or adding a stat bonus, argue for it now.
Whether or not you succeed, an encounter will be had. The result of your danger roll just decides how well your encounter will go.

After the Danger Roll has been rolled, the GM also rolls 2d6, basing the encounter table on this blogpost by Papers and Pencils, adding, consequently a dragon and a wizard (or in this case, witch) to the module.

I may want to do a bigger FIST post down the line, or maybe a micro-setting using FIST as the core system, but in the mean time, here is my attempt at a few premade characters randomly generated:

HP: 3, ARMOR 6, ATT+1


Wolves in the Borderlands are common. They roam the forests in packs. While the North American wolves might be known to be afraid of humans in general, the European wolves are bigger and meaner than that and have been known to attack humans when hungry. 


In the Borderlands, the strange and chaotic forces that permeate this area sometimes changes things about the wolves and make them strange.


The chance of this alteration occurring will depend on how much of a foothold chaos has on the lands. I suggest starting with a 1/6 chance, triggering on a 6, adding +1 to each time ‘regular’ wolves are rolled. And add a +1 for each rank of a foothold Chaos has on the lands.






The Eurasian Grey Wolf, found free to use on Wikipedia



The Wolves of the Borderland might…
1. Talk and understand humans. They know to use this to attract prey.
2. Leave ashen paw prints that remain warm to the touch for a night and a day.
3. Have a howl that makes you think your feet suddenly sink into the ground and are stuck.  
Roll DANGER +WIL or be paralyzed with fear for a round.
4. Have the ability to grow to the size of cows.
Double HP, +1 to ATTACK
5. Be ridden by kobolds wanting to cause mischief of the deadly kind. 
They will use their own devious skills to make fighting harder, like riding with a line of rope between them to try and trip up people, shooting arrows that might paralyze or put you to sleep, etc.
6. Have the ability to breathe a cloud of mist, making ranged attacks on them harder, forcing people to have to go hand to hand, or to make it easier for them to flee.</span>

                              <span>Sometimes I make kung fu posts. I&#x27;ve started using the &#x60;kung-fu&#x60; label to aggregate them. Click on this label to read my other mutterings on this subject.
I&#x27;ve been watching Shaw Brothers films at the gym this summer. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar, Shaw Brothers was a prolific Hong Kong production company that produced grindhouse kung fu films. Basically, all the audio samples from Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) were from these films. 
&gt; Frog style is incredibly strong and immune to nearly any weapon.
I like some of the films more than I like others, but almost all of them have something that made me say &quot;Ha ha neat.&quot; Almost all of them have something gameable. 
In this post, I&#x27;m going to step through the Shaw Brothers&#x27; film Clan of the White Lotus beat by beat. Heavy spoilers warning, obviously. …</span>

Mother to goblins and hobgoblins


Trying to find a source for this picture led me to a deactivated Tumblr for Cultur Tava.



HP:4 // ARMOR 6* (impervious to physical harm until a certain protection is dealt with)
SPELL SLOTS: 5 // Special Item: Cursing Charm


It is said that the witch Magobia cannot have children of her own and that because of that she resolved to steal babies for her own. 
• Some say that it’s because she’s barren, some say that it’s because she’s too mean for anyone to want a relationship with her.  
• Rumor goes that her desire for children has led her to kidnapping them and feeding them her special witch-food, turning them into goblins and hobgoblins in the process. 
 • She is followed around by what looks like a black cat that has the power,…</span>

Setup
Before you start exploring the Ages, establish the basics of your setting.
First agree on the tone of your world. Is it an eerie lonely experience? Or are the ages still bustling with life? Decide with your group and note down a couple of adjectives.
Create a foundational age and a device (following their respective instructions in the next chapter). Describe why this age serves as a crossroads to other ages. Name this age.

Gros Jean: Ogre of the woods
HP:12, ARMOR:8, +2AB, STR+2, Ogre Great-Club (2-handed, Ogre Sized, +1DMG), Wearing treated bearskin as armour (+1ARM, already calculated)


Gros Jean is the ogre that roams these parts of the country. He mainly works as a mercenary for the forces of Chaos. He recently has come in possession of an unholy symbol of the dark forces, that will slowly corrupt his mind, offering him dark powers. Gros Jean has an agreement with the Witch Magobia that if the goblins pay him, he will protect them, as he can have some of the babies she brings in as food.


When Gros Jean is met in the wild he…
 1. Is eating and will tolerate weary travelers to join. 
2. Is admiring his ruby necklace of the Snake.
 3. Has a manacled prisoner on a chain and is sitting down with a pensive smile brainstorming on an apt punishment for the oath the prisoner broke. 
4. Is very hungry and looking for food. You look tasty. Or do you perhaps have a baby?
 5. Is grumpy and angry because his prisoner escaped. 
6. Is hanging chains with stone skulls on them on a prisoner. One for each of the men he promised to bring back safely, but failed to do so. He has to cary these around wherever they go.


Ogres are descendants of the old Roman deity called Orcus. They roam the world, eating babies (preferably) and enjoying in punishing oath-breakers. 


There are more ogres in the land, but not a lot. They do not get along very much and as such remain a good distance away from each other. If they get too close to each other, the land cannot sustain their appetite all that much and they will fight over food. Sometimes an ogre will find a mate though, and somehow they manage to tolerate each other. Woe betide the lands where this is the case.</span>

 Why this trap doesn’t suck: The possible rewards are tantalizing. (A mysterious tower? What’s in it?) The dangers are obvious. (The lake is bright green! Acid is deadly!) This is an open-ended problem with many pos…</span>

Hobgoblins: 
HP: 4 // ARMOR 6

                              <span>Goblins in the movie Labyrinth, by Jim Henson. Part of the inspiration.

 
Goblins: 
HP: 2 // ARMOR 6
stats for Maze Rats


It is true that Goblins were children stolen from their crib and turned into goblins by the Witch Magobia. The following is also true about them:
• They never grow bigger than a toddler, as their growth is stunted by their strange diet.
• Their skin gets an unhealthy grey and wrinkles as if they are of very old age. Their pupils turn a very pale-pink color and their hair a greasy black.
 • Most grow up to be mean, fearful and craven.


When encountering Goblins in the wild they… 
• Try to hide or run away if you are stronger than them. 
• Are singing a dreadful song that teaches to be mean. 
• Are carrying a stolen baby and arguing about who has to take care of it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m running the Borderlands via play-by-post over discord, and I&#x27;m using Maze Rats to do it. I like how it gives me extra incentive to reinvent things as I have to convert things anyway. One of these things is that I&#x27;ve been thinking about Fire Beetles and how they might be regarded in my take on a setting, a Medieval France type deal, where all the weird stuff is actually still weird. And I want to keep it that way. Things should be mysterious and unexplainable. I was first thinking of expanding the bugs into stages of life etc. but decided not to do that. Anyway, this is my first draft.

In this post I wanted to talk about using objects and locations in RPGs to tell a history or fiction. I believe we already use environmental storytelling in our games, however I wanted to delve deeper—understand how we can consciously apply this concept to our settings.
Motivation
The OSR play culture is particularly interested in exploring fantastical locations. Lots of focus is put into creating these spaces that the referee describes to the players. In turn, the players are expected to interact in these spaces as much as possible. Players usually explore ruins or derelicts of some kind, so the objects within them will always have a history.

The 2nd Age 

The 2nd Age is a tabletop RPG supplement containing 12 institutions intended to supplant traditional classes for games that prefer a more materialist approach to advancement. 
When using these institutions, power is gained primarily as a reward for your service to the empire of Turandor through one of its institutions.

But it went better than I could have hoped. This was some good Social Intrigue, which I am all about. I don&#x27;t know how well this will translate to a PR, despite my efforts to make these PRs more interesting.


I was inspired by the Scales of Conviction system for the videogame Triangle Strategy, where key plot events are decided on a vote, and the player has to talk to the various NPCs and gather information to try to sway the votes of the rest of the party. I figured that would work even better in a TTRPG, and it did. At some point either here or on Iconoclastic Flo…</span>

                              <span>A short post explaining why I think spaceships with wings can work in a hard sci-fi setting. And I will not be talking about landings here, since wings aren’t crucial for that. Instead I will introduce you to the concept of aerogravity assist.
Not to be confused with aerobreaking, which is a manoeuvre that uses the atmosphere of a planet to slow down a spacecraft. Aerogravity assist uses the atmosphere to speed up instead.
A common manoeuvre in space travel is the gravity assist—using a planets gravity well as a slingshot to deflect your trajectory. The closer you get to the planet, the more your course will be changed. The issue is that you are limited by the planets atmosphere. If you come too close, the drag will significantly reduce your speed and the costs will outweigh the benefits.

                              <span>This is an old draft, way before I decided to start using Concept Crafting for Mecha Gear. I think in all likelihood it&#x27;s too fiddly, and I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with it even at the time, but it&#x27;s interesting seeing how it got me to where it is now.




This is for my Into the Odd Mecha Hack: Get Into the Machine, Shinji! The mechanics have changed to varying degrees since I&#x27;ve been running my MRD2 Campaign, but this post more so corresponds to the original GitMS! than to MRD2. Most notably, it is no longer the case in MRD2 that Golem (the Mecha) have their own Ability Scores anymore, instead just sharing the pilot Ability Scores, but having their own Damage dice and of course the Gear.

                              <span>Locked Doors or Containers are a time-honored obstacle to exploration and discovery. They present an opportunity for the clever Thief to fiddle with their tools to flex their percentiles, the Fighter to muscle things open with a sturdy d6, or the Magic User to unleash a mighty Knock. If only there were another way?
 The presence of a Lock implies the existence of a Key. Here are a Hundred places where that pesky unlocker might live. Much like my previous posts on Secret or Stuck Doors, some imply a puzzle or a skosh of Set Dressing as well. Some of the particularly tricky ones might be worthy of rewarding the Players with a passe-partout.</span>

                              <span>The &quot;Mythic Underworld&quot; is a term popular in the OSR that I believe was coined by Jason Cone in Philotomy&#x27;s Musings. Cone argued that the rules of OD&amp;D can be interpreted to suggest that the &quot;dungeons&quot; that adventurers delve into aren&#x27;t really to be understood as real, logical spaces created by normal people or natural processes. Rather, they&#x27;re more like a surreal, dreamlike, and hostile realm that runs on its own twisted logic, which might be inconsistent. It gives the referee some leeway to make a contrived, game-y, &quot;funhouse&quot; dungeon instead of stressing about accuracy or rationality.

Much of what Cone describes are just traits of megadungeons, or even simply dungeons in general. Things like, &quot;non-linear pathways&quot; and &quot;lots of connections between levels&quot; aren&#x27;t really mythic, they&#x27;re …</span>

The best monsters are not merely a big sack of hit points you hack-n-slash your way through because of a random encounter table. No, they&#x27;re something more. They have qualities possible only through the conceits of fantasy. They challenge your brain just as much as your stats and dice. They stick in the mind. They&#x27;re not just a one-and-done encounter. They&#x27;re grounded in the world and its rules, and can&#x27;t be understood merely with numbers. And maybe most of all, they&#x27;re robust enough that reckoning with them is the whole adventure, or at least could be the whole adventure.


A very popular piece of advice in the OSR is &quot;Just Use Bears.&quot; The basic argument is that, &quot;monsters which don&#x27;t have elaborate special abiliti…</span>

                              <span>My first meeting with the Morrow Project came in the guise of Different Worlds Magazine, Issue 33 which I inherited along with two issues of Dragon, a copy of the AD&amp;D 1e Players Handbook, Moldvay Basic Set, and a handful of modules. The meeting was brief. A short module featuring a plague carrying biker gang along with some Q&amp;A of the authors. But it wormed the game into my brain and eventually I scrounged pdf&#x27;s for it out of the corners of the internet and read through them. 


And I was charmed. Its an old, idiosyncratic game but interesting in its presentation of details and has some surprisingly well made modules. So as I reread the Morrow Project&#x27;s books I will be reviewing them, in hopes that this might introduce other folks to the game.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a few sessions into my MRD2 Campaign. Scheduling an IRL game is a nightmare or else I&#x27;d have liked to be a bit further into the campaign by now, but it&#x27;s nice to be playing IRL again regardless. I&#x27;m realizing now that I&#x27;ve referenced Nazarite Contracts in the PRs and some of the other posts, but have not formally shared anything on them here.


The Nazarite Contracts of MRD2 are equivalent to the Poltergeist Forms of MRD1, the character classes.

I&#x27;m trying to invoke this especially in the stuff I&#x27;m writing lately, and it always helps to have some jumping off points for the Big Foundational Questions of a setting - the character of the ancient people that came before, and the reason they&#x27;re no longer here.
