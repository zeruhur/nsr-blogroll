                              <span>Just a quick table that I was reminded of today going through my folders. I believe I whipped this up for another Referee in need quite some time ago, but after giving it another gander and thought it might be of use to others.
 Kind of a contemporary counterpart to my Random Impedimenta. Might also be useful for post-apocalyptic games or ones set in slightly older historical periods, as there is a whiff of anachronism in some of these. These days most of my tables are geared toward Fantasy, but even in that context I’ll admit to sometimes sprinkling in the occasional item from this as an intriguing/puzzling out-of-place artifact or a teaspoon dosage of gonzo. I always endeavor to render the trinket via a description rather than name it though in these situations 😊</span>

I started up a new local Galaxy Far Away campaign just over a week ago, and I realized I did not take a liking to the standard opposed 2d6 resolution that I originally penned for the game. Maybe it&#x27;s because using d6 in Star Wars should belong with West End Games&#x27; timeless take on the genre, or maybe because I tend to find traditional opposed resolution less and less compelling these days. 
I have grown stale on finding out if something happens or not. Instead, stuff always happens. The question is not &quot;does it happen?&quot; but &quot;how?&quot; and I&#x27;m finding that said qualitative result generation is much more interesting than pass/fail. I&#x27;m not reinventing the wheel here, as the whole &quot;yes, and&quot; or &quot;yes, but&quot; …</span>

                              <span>Now and again, I come across Referees considering Cantrips as a way of adding a little bit more Magic to their Spellcasters. These are a sometimes-contentious subject because some implementations result in these abilities interfering with or obviating interesting parts of play such as Resource Management. Another common issue sometimes has to do more with Setting conceits, and how they can sometimes transmogrify something treasured or rare into a thing much more mundane or humdrum.
   
But take heart! Not all sorceries need be showy ones, and the wonder these sorts of “special effects” can evoke can sometimes add more than they subtract from play if we are just a little scrupulous in how they function.

                              <span>Yesterday it was pointed out to me that I had been remiss with providing a Random Table for generating Mushrooms/Toadstools, which is indeed a tragedy considering how fond I am of sprinkling “fun” fungi as Resources and Hazards within my Wilderness Adventures. So, I aimed to rectify this oversight post-haste by moving this Table to the top of the dev pile (where in all fairness, it sprouted with almost uncanny swiftness).
 These can be used in conjunction with my venerable Herb &amp; Plant Generator, and although the Name-stems are intended to be used to generate new and unusual Local Common Names, you can just as easily read across if swiftness is required and treat this more like a standard d100 table. I often like a quick name for flavoring Foraging Results as “You found some Edible Mushrooms” is just so frightfully bland.
 Use your best judgement to determine an appropriate randomizer if you find yourself in need of a “Number Appearing” (I&#x27;m rather fond of 2d6 with &quot;Doubles Add and Roll Again&quot; most of the time, but you could also randomize the die type to use with a quick d8: d4 through d100.) I prefer to heavily festoon some places in evocative fungi as a mood-enhancer, but a few of these are probably best when more precious and significantly rarer. If not expressly edible, and you find yourself in need of a nastier consequence for the foolhardy consumer, there is always my Terrible Toxins &amp; Vile Venoms Table as well.</span>

So your mice have suddenly come to power in a local settlement? Have they been granted rule by a noblemice? Have organised a clever coup? Well, now they have new problems of managing a township. This post is written to guide you through this tricky process.
township turn
When mice perform town managing duties, time is divided into township turns, which last about a week. At the start of each township turn, roll a district die which will inform what happens on that turn.

1
Encounter
New characters arrive to the settlement. A merchant caravan, an attack by evil cats, or humans start meddling with the tree you dwell under.


2
Ruin
Buildings and structures age and/or get damaged.

                              <span>Since last year I was toying myself with the idea to write a setting inspired by Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Hayao Miyazaki’s masterpiece. The first attempt was last year to submit for InPlay #3 (then never issued, alas), but I was not able to meet the deadline.
The idea stuck in my mind, for merrier times. Then other project came, fatherhood and everything connected to it.
Until Yochai Gal launched the *Forest of Another Name” Cairn Jam last month. The original deadline was March 31st and I know it was totally impossible for me to meet that deadline. Then it has postponed to April 15th and I was able to start writing my submission in time.
The result is Taintedweald, a mini-setting in a 24 pages zine. Let’s see it in detail!

                              <span>Growing up around Horses, how I use them in these games might be one of my vernacular tells. One of those little things that I always seem to do, despite what the system might say. When I was younger, I had the privilege of spending some of my Summers with these animals, grooming, riding, but mostly I remember mucking out intolerably mephitic and sweltering Stables for extra pocket money (some of which even went to Roleplaying Game Books!).
Horses can be incredibly frustrating and thick-headed creatures, or remarkably patient and even helpful. Some are tender and kind, others are just plain mean to anything that walks on two feet or four. Getting to gradually know them over time, you soon learn little peculiarities and peccadillos that might not be obvious at first glance. Each one ends up…</span>

I&#x27;ve played in or run a handful of &gt;1yr long campaigns so far, and this is only the second to come to a proper conclusion, and the first to do so satisfactorily. This campaign truly lived up to the ideals of what I had intended MRD to be, and did so in a way that I had not anticipated, driven by the actions of the Players and the decisions they made given the conceits I presented to them. We&#x27;ll be following up with a new campaign where one of the Players will take over as GM with their own modified take on MRD, and I&#x27;ll be running an MRD2 campaign with a new group IRL, but this feels like a milestone in the jou…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s that time again--secret jackalope! Magos of the Mind#1349 wants &quot;Beyond Humanoid: or guidance for playing something without hands I guess. Can be something like the &quot;Really Good Dog&quot;* glog class or something more original/alien.&quot;
We take it for granted that we have two average human hands. You can eat a sandwich, fold your clothes, and stare at your smartphone for much more time than is necessary with typical hands. Take those away, and you get all sorts of curious different conceptions of everyday ambulation and motor control. 
So what do you do without hands? Are you like Zacian, from Generation VIII Pokemon, who is a superpowered dog that holds a straight-up legendary sword in its mouth? That is, admittedly, quite rad.

 Oftentimes I like to encourage any Magic-Users to tailor the appearance of their dweomers a bit: Customizing them by Caster for a little individuality. I often find myself doing this for Foes to keep the other players on their toes as well. The rather generic description of the Shield Spell is one that I felt could use a little sprucing now-and-then. Invisible fields of force might still function of course, but it seems like a missed opportunity to make that Magic less monotonous and a little more Magical. 😊
 Here are a hundred ideas for dressing up those defensive spells. This is solely intended to serve as a dollop of fluff and flavor of course...Unless?</span>

                              <span>Here is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek diversion from what might be considered slightly more useful Random Tables. It has always been extremely interesting to me how the standard Equipment lists in these games do so much heavy lifting to telegraph Setting, and I often tend to see players new to the game gravitate to a few of the same things.
 Allium sativum on the list alongside other, perhaps more practical, purchases for Dungeon Delving is one of these. Its mere presence seems to scream to some that the possibility of Vampires is not only very real, but something they ought to prepare for. The same way those lovely Saving Throw Categories, so starkly listed on their sheet, stoically advertise other dangers.
 But what may have gone unnoticed is just how pricey that lovely little Bulb can be. A little casual research reveals that it tends to stay remarkably stable pricewise in these older games. Naturally, this led me to wonder Why?
 So, here is a table of a Hundred ways to address this burning question (admittedly over-contemplated on my part) and these weird implications. It just goes to show that there are all sorts of lovely little nuances living in those lists that are hiding and waiting to be revealed by Referee’s with perhaps too much time on their hands.😂</span>

                              <span>I’ve come up with what I think is an interesting and useful way of thinking about RPGs, but the seeds of it were planted in my head by an unlikely source.
I was watching this GDC talk by Mick Gordon about how he created the music for Doom (2016). In it, he describes how his main instrument for the game was a simple sine wave — what he describes as the purest form of sound — filtered through four channels of machines that distort the “pure” sound into something industrial, noisy, and full of character.
In a previous post, I described all RPGs as the product of different kinds of “creative constraints” upon play-pretend, which you might call the “purest form” of RPG. I listed various kinds of constraints, but this GDC talk made me think — what if I reorganized those constraints into four cha…</span>

                              <span>Yet another table that had been languishing on the dev pile for far too long! Here we have One Hundred Magical Mishaps or Calamitous Curses to inflict upon the table. Since some games don’t have a “Roll To Cast” system in place, these could also be repurposed for all manner of other unfortunate Eldritch Events. Potion Miscibility is popular, but they may also prove useful for Failed Experiments, Scrambled Scrolls, or Grimoires Protected from Prying Eyes. Some of them make mighty fine Horrible Hexes as well, much more memorable and meaningful than a mechanical malus (that players have a remarkable tendency to conveniently forget to apply!)
 Grafting on additional risk to Spell Casting is something I’ve done in the past. However, I feel it works a bit better if it’s accompanied by a correspondingly tempting reward. One that I particularly enjoyed was allowing a thrill-seeking Magic User to choose to roll a Saving Throw versus Spells after Casting, on a success the Spell is retained and they may cast it again. On a failure, the Spell is lost as with normal Vancian magics. On a 1, a Magical Mishap occurs. One can tweak the frequency of these fantastic failures to taste, or potentially even penalize the Save by the level of the Spell or number of prior retentions attempts in a given time-period. When Magic becomes predictable and repeatable, it can sometimes veer toward banality, so this at least tries to maintain a bit of that delicious wonder should one go down this route.    
A small amount of effort was put into “tuning” this table a bit, so that smaller die sizes have less “consequential” impacts, so feel free to escalate these however you see fit. What happens with a d6 should be a little less severe than something rolled higher on a d30, with the more disastrous consequences generally occurring only on upper ends of the d100. Durations are occasionally included, but feel free to season those to taste, and as with all misfortunes some just might be possible to undo through additional Adventure.</span>

                              <span>I wrote this little White Box: FMAG hack over the course of the past few hours. I like how Spwack posts little hacks straight to their blog, so I figured I&#x27;d try something similar.
I basically just stripped down how Worlds Without Number does ability checks and simplified attacking to one roll. The non-standard attributes, combat order, and Difficult Movement rules come from my big WIP, Goblets &amp; Grues.
I might try using this to run OSE adventures and the like, who knows.

This can sometimes demystify these majestic Monsters a bit, so here’s a table that might provide some additional inspiration to surprise and bewilder by eschewing that predictability. Should you need an unusual shade for their scales to shimmer see the perchance generator below.
  
Naturally, one should assume that any standard effects and procedures associated with being doused in Dragon Breath should apply. These are merely adjuncts. Coupled with my prior post on Monster Special Attacks, I suppose this could also be used for foes of a less draconic nature should this be your bag.</span>

Mecha are sometimes described as being a metaphor for the body- which makes sense, they are humanoid giant robots, often unnecessarily anthropomorphized, and often used to tell stories about the adolescent experience or the brutality of war. I don&#x27;t mean to suggest this is all that Mecha entail, but this alone can be explored in ways that I have rarely if ever seen.


In the first post, the Golem (the MRD2 term for Mecha) were mostly extrapolations of humans as units within greater superorganisms- Entropy Elancer existing partially in the Fourth Wall outside spacetime, Lycaon Strain a macroscopic distributed organism, and Hibernating Hyberia an encrypted c…</span>

For the shift that I was in, there would be three games that would be played, an 1st Edition AD&amp;D game, a home-brew game and Starfinder. I had signed up for Starfinder. The day before I heard that Starfinder was cancelled as the GM had contracted Covid. I said that there was no problem, I would come and either join one of the other games or quickly do some kind of improv game.
I arrived, barely on time on Saturday, with some options in my backpack, which turned out to be nice, because of all the people that had said they would come, only four people were there, including the organizer. The guy running first edition needed 6 people for his game…</span>

                              <span>I.

I&#x27;ve been working for a while now on a new game. Confusingly, I&#x27;m calling it G&amp;G (Goblets &amp; Grues), which is what my failed project from over a year ago was also called.

What can I say? I really like the name. This is just a short post about a new mechanic I just added to the draft rules that I&#x27;m really excited to try out.

So, the idea of this new G&amp;G is to combine a focus on exploration and problem solving with a light emphasis on tactical combat. I miss 5E and how the differentiation of roles in combat makes every player feel important.
How to marry these two things? The two approaches seem irreconcilable...

&quot;Combat as war&quot; gameplay positions the uncertainty of combat as something to be mitigated or avoided entirely.

                              <span>An earlier version of this post was first shared on The Cauldron. I&#x27;ve fallen behind a bit and digging into my backlog, but I do have a few upcoming blog posts in mind that are more directly RPG related.






Pokemon is obviously a huge decades-long phenomenon of a franchise requiring no introduction. Yet despite this fact, I am surprised by just how little impact it has had on fiction, how little regard is paid to the fact that it is a unique science fiction or fantasy sub-genre. My intention for this post is to describe what I think makes Pokemon unique as a sub-genre, and using that as a case example for how to go about thinking about works of fiction and how they might be extrapolated into new kinds of sub-genres, which can then be explored in tabletop RPG form.

Its head is a mass of megaphones and televisions, bulldozer blades and backhoe scoops. Alternatingly chewing a path and whispering honeyed songs of &#x27;job growth&#x27; and &#x27;cheap gas&#x27; to merchants and statesmen, easing its passage. 


Minions, like melted riot police, oily black as tar, spawn from its leaking gaskets and move out in oozing phalanxes to beat back those that would stop the snakes progress. 


It will slither ever forward unless slain. Beware its children who nest in the bowls of refinery sprawl.


Big Black Snake 
10 HD, AC as plate, Save vs Churning Digging Equipment (head) or Crushing Coils (body)

Wants to slither onward, poisoning the land.
Spawns Tar Minions to protect itself.
Enlists the aid of the powerful with honeyed promises.

Use shield wall and encirclement tactics.

When I was 12, I was introduced to RPGs. I said &quot;Oh I will make one for Lord of the Rings.&quot; I went home and wrote it in a notebook. 
It was terrible. 
For the last 20 years, I have been chasing this white whale. Here is what I have learned:
There is no one, perfect game. There is only the perfect game for the campaign you want to run (some assembly required). 
If you want to run a Tolkien game, there are a lot of resources to help you assemble the right game for you, both licensed and unlicensed. 
What&#x27;s this post about?
Given this story and this blog I suspect no one is surprised that I have Opinions (TM) about Lord of the Rings games.

Making travel fun
Alchemical subsystems
Dungeon Meshi
What IS the GLoG?
Enriching PDFs with digital tools
The current state of HIS MAJESTY THE WORM


Plus, I made this very handsome face.

I.


The Gyldir Vale is a temperate river valley enclosed by the sharp and rocky Red Range to the west; the ancient, forested Green Range to the east; and the magnificent, snow-capped White Range to the north.


The valley&#x27;s name is derived from the Golden Flame, the mysterious source of power with which Rotangur barbarians conquered this land from the high elves 1,000 years ago.

The “Retainer Test Subject” approach seldom seems appealing to players, since the “Guinea Pig” often clamors to keep it (and why should they not? They assumed the risk!).

I&#x27;m frontloading the negative, because that aside, it&#x27;s a truly creative and brilliant show and I really appreciate it for what it is.

To help the process along, I figured I would make some qualitative systems that sort of line up with how I tend to do things at the table. Mind you, this isn&#x27;t what I actually consciously have in the back of my head while running, but I think using this will land you in a similar place. 

To help understand where I am coming from it might be useful to keep in mind what my number one principle is when running games: Fluff &#x3D; Crunch. Both for players, as well as for GMs.

With that out of the way, here&#x27;s some systems:

                              <span>I browse &quot;new free physical games&quot; on itch.io at least a couple of times a week. Today I had time to write a blog post about what I found. I might do more of these if people dig it and if I find the time.

Tools, Tables, Mechanics, and Mosaics
Lines and Circles 

So this is a Mosaic Strict procedure that provides a structure for players to model a romantic relationship. In a lot of ways Lines and Circles strikes me as a lyric game. It’s interesting to read, beautiful in a way, esoteric, and only kind of a game. 

But then I think about how it might be more than that. The mechanics themselves aren’t much. You pick a type of relationship (line or circle) and progress through some scenes, negotiating what happens, and gaining and losing bond points as you go. Normally I avoid romantic relatio…</span>

I&#x27;ve put together a proof of concept for something I&#x27;ve been calling the Hexcrawl Dashboard: a patchwork of iFramed tools cobbled together onto a single site for ease of GM access. The gimmick is that you have a single page for your map, your encounters, your random encounters, your dungeons, your monster&#x27;s stats - anything you need to reference during play.

Pig Faced Orc by Trash Mob Minis



In the game I play with the kids using RISUS, the orcs are Pig Men who are dirty, gluttonous and lazy. Evil is also comically evil in this game, because I’m playing with young kids. This makes these encounters and scenes a lot more fun than dangerous, though there is danger and —depending on the sensibilities of the kids— lethal. Though situations should play out in such a way that evil should not triumph but rather defeat itself.


I started thinking about this because in the game I play when we’re done early in class, the kid made it until the caves and decided to check out cave C. So I’ve been reading that entry lately, thinking about how I could run it for this 6 or 7 year old kid. And I tho…</span>

I have a ton of folders of collected artwork for D&amp;D inspiration. I was just thinking to myself that they could make for a good post. Why not start here? 


I hope you like women in armor, because I have many digital binders full of &#x27;em. This collection skews towards European knight aesthetics because I&#x27;m a hack. Feel free to correct that in the comments by contributing more pics. 


I&#x27;ve tried to credit everyone. This isn&#x27;t exhaustive or anything, these are just the pieces I&#x27;ve come across over the years that I enjoyed enough to save.
