                              <span>An interesting conversation on Twitter about ways to make Magic weilded by Magic-Users a little less reliable for a more distinctive and wonderous feel (somewhat like the Taboo System I use for Clerics) got me thinking, and before I knew it I had the makings of a Table. I had some semi-similar things (like my recent Flaws &amp; Foibles or perhaps my Magical Mishaps &amp; Calamitous Curses), but nothing that quite fit the bill.
Personifying the Magic made it a little easier to produce some of these entries, feel free to season that bit to taste. I’m not quite sure how I’d use them (Maybe in exchange for more Casting Ability? Perhaps every Magic User specializes or has their own personal connections?) but I’d probably try to make them meaningful in terms of interpretation.
 Sure seems like several of the recent tables have been a bit Caster-centric. I really need to polish up a few more of my Fighter-friendly tables at some point 😊.</span>

                              <span>No, this isn&#x27;t about Vancian vs. such-and-such. I guess it&#x27;s more like different schools of magic like Illusion, Evocation, etc., but it&#x27;s not bound to those classifications either. It&#x27;s just meant to get you to think about weird abstract things, and what magic can mean, and how different principles of science and philosophy and cognition and perception operate.


My character in Mike of Sheep &amp; Sorcery&#x27;s Weirdways Campaign (previously discussed in this post) also more recently gained powers relating to the first entry, so that&#x27;s cool.


There aren&#x27;t that many of these because I&#x27;ve been busy and tired lately and trying to prioritize shorter high quality posts over forcing out longer ones, but I&#x27;m happy with these.

                              <span>Sometimes one finds oneself in a situation where there is an immediate need to Introduce a new PC to a Party whilst the adventure is currently in progress. Their character falls, and after the comforting clatter of dice, they have made a new one: But by what means do they get ushered into play?
 Here is a table that might supply a skosh of inspiration or at least some “starting points” for these sticky situations where there’s need for a Sudden Entrance, Stage Left. Like most of my tables, it might need a bit of strategic tailoring to the specific situation and taste. Remember the Trick behind all those seemingly stray Capital Letters: Capitalized Words can always be freely substituted/specified/adjusted to fit.
 I’m afraid that most of these might impinge on Player Agency a bit, but I’ve always felt that a player character’s Prologue was fairer game for such things, and it’s a small price to pay for being able to leap back into the action I suppose. I’ve tried to shy away from some of the ones I’ve seen used that put the Character or Player in some of the more uncomfortable spots, and leaning into a bit of mystery and unanswered questions to flesh out in play is never a bad thing in my book. One could even just have them roll (or even select!) an entry that strikes them as that final step of creating their new character. A bit of brief, hopefully  actionable backstory never hurt anyone, and who knows where it could lead? 😊
 Several of these entries are ones I’ve found myself having to use in the past, some even served as Session/Campaign Starters in their own right or Premises for One-Shot Games, so I’m sure there might be a bit of additional hidden utility in this table if one approaches it from other angles.</span>

Continuing my Sojourner series, I was thinking about sandbox play. In this post I describe the way I run my sci-fi sandbox campaigns that is compatible with any system. To start off you will need a couple of worlds and factions with interconnected relationships.
Working for both sides of the blockade to make ends meet. Crushing starship debt. Time is nothing but adding weeks and subtracting credits. They say that a month in space is darker than any darker. No starlight reaches these depths ever. Human eyes were not meant to see it.
Procedure
Campaign time is measured in months. In a month the crew can: visit a starport, travel between nearby worlds, or repair severe ship damage.
At the start of every month roll for an event:

Saves and Levels: As a thief
Proficiencies: As a magic-user
Runes: At level 1, gain three random runes. Every level thereafter, gain one random rune. 
With a week of downtime and 1,000 silver in magical materials (mithril inks, obsidian mirrors, lights reflected from distant stars), you may attempt to research a specific rune. At the end of the week, Save vs Wands. If successful, you learn the rune you were researching. If you fail, you do not learn the rune and your research is wasted.


Note: Runes map 1-to-1 with the English alphabet equivalent. Runes are just cooler than &quot;letters.&quot;

A dying overextended empire. Merchant guilds squabbling over scraps. Outlaws roaming the few trade routes left. War after war. Spoils of which fuel what they call the economy. You cannot change what is bound to occur. The most complex machine the universe has ever seen has reached its warranty. You might just die in service of it.
Burdens
Burdens are negative modifiers to your skill rolls. Severe burdens count as rank 2. So for example severe debt is equivalent to debt 2.

Being usable by anyone (provided they can read them aloud), they really scratch a particular itch for me: They provide the ability to put Magic and Wonder in the hands of Classes that don’t normally have the capability to tangibly access this aspect of play. An athaumic Fighter, unfurling that fluttering page of parchment to have that chance to harness some Magic occasionally is a very fun thing. I also enjoy how they generally serve as timely “bacon-savers” of the highest degree: They are an excellent example of a specific Tool, that when used in the proper circumstances, can really make a world of difference.

I like the idea of bumping it up to 15min, but I also have not quite 15min before I need to start work, and I try to post on at least a weekly basis, and as Save vs. TPK said recently I&#x27;m trying to be more comfortable with shorter posts.


I&#x27;ll use one of Attnam&#x27;s prompts, and in this case I rolled Incursion, so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing.


And... GO!

A spectrum of light perpendicular to light as we know it, intersecting at green, breaches the electromagnetic barrier.
Reality is in fact a dream, and for the first time, you experience oneiric wakefulness.
The universe is an Ouroboros. As it comes closer to consuming itself, entropic unraveling exponentiates.
Breaching the wall of life and death like puncturing choking cellophane, a pleasant and disturbing compression.
Transduced consciousness into soundwaves and decomposed along frequency-power axes via Fourier Transform.

These were adequate. Until next time...</span>

Idea : The aviary burial crypt of an ancient demon meant to be kept locked away 


Hook : Wizard&#x27;s paying you to crack open this tomb and bring back its contents


Encounters :


A. 1d8 devil peacocks with flaming eyes and golden tail feathers, prowling about crooning praises of their lord. 


B. 2d4 tomb guardians wrapped in scripture-inscribed cloth, lugging copper-swords, bellowing warnings at interlopers. Detest the peacocks, pity the skeletons.


C. 1d4 golden skeletons aimlessly whispering, grasp at the living in hopes of dragging them back to their slumbering master and having their flesh restored in reward.

                              <span>I’ve been playing a lot more solo sessions, and I didn’t want to clog this place up. Plus, I just wanted to experiment with something different. So in April, my spinoff blog Solo Skald launched. So far, I’ve played campaigns of Blades in the Dark as well as Scum &amp; Villainy, a solo adventure with … Continue reading Spinoff solo blog →</span>

                              <span>Drawbacks and Complications for Magic are something I’m fairly fond of using in my games. A useful item, with an inconvenient defect is more memorable, just as a Cursed item with just enough usefulness to hang onto can also be more fun than metagame conceits that keep it in player hands. 
   
It is always appealing to me when one of these snags ends up being a boon with the proper creative application. Just like how my Unconventional Potions and some of my other Magic Item posts end up embellishing these creations with features that might just be a perfect key for a lock yet unknown, some of these entries might end up working in a similar fashion. 
   
Here is a list of a hundred of these sorts of impediments and imperfections. You could even use them to garb Spells themselves, Familiars, Magic Item Creation, or other wonderous things with a little bit of creative adjustment.</span>

                              <span>Per the methodology from Priestess of Spiders.

Idea : A haunted and overgrown amphitheater complex used as a hideout by brigands


Hook : Rescue the son of a merchant whose being held for ransom


Encounters :


A. 1d6 brigands, flaunting cockades and toting knives and pistols, on patrol. Swaggering and joking among each other, not really expecting anything. 


B. 1d4 ghosts, singing and muttering their lines, will ask you to join in a play, if satisfied they will gift you a silver gilded thespian mask, if refused they will conjure up a miniature tempest.


C. The brigand prince, dressed in plundered finery, mediating a dispute between two brigands over the proper ownership of a bejeweled goblet, a duel looks to be in order. 


Key :


Trap/Hazards 


A web of strings hung with bells across the easiest approach into the amphitheater, if disturbed the ringing will alert 1d6 brigands who will come to investigate. 


A makeshift fire-pit surrounded by 1d8 snoring brigands who roll and shift uneasily in their sleep. A very large and obvious iron key ring hangs on the far wall.


&quot;Empty&quot;


The stage, wooden boards sagging and pierced through with growing trees in places, looking up you can see the whole of the encircling bleachers.


Old musty prop closets, digging around unearths two intact silk robes and a tarnished silver amulet. 


A gnarled tree growing out of the stands, its roots split apart the stones allowing one to easily drop down into an old dusty under-passage. 


Special 


The acoustics when standing in the seats are perfect to amplify any sounds three-fold and let you displace it as though a ventriloquist anywhere in the structure. 


Non-Player Character


Umberto, an amateur con artist the brigands mistook for a noble and are holding captive. He has made friends with the ghosts who occasionally visit him to put on miniature dramas, though they are reluctant to help him escape.</span>

For every youth there comes a time to go rambling on a long tour of the stars, some keep it small; just the local hives, others hop ship-to-ship with the strange shell-less foreigners to odd worlds. Everyone comes home eventually, with stories a-plenty to tell of their adventures.

Symbiote shell-suit (crustacean-esq, vacuum-rated, maneuvering jets, alive)
Mushroom-cricket pemmican (wrapped in bio-plastic, leftovers fed to suit)
Dagger-axe, short hafted
Rigging knife
Cable coil, weighted end (lassoing)
Fertilizer brick (compressed phosphates &amp; nitrates wrapped in cheap gold foil)
Leg-braces
Membrane tent (with airlock)
Shell-paint, turquoise (vacuum-rated)
Story-songs : The Many Quest-Rovings of Yohann the Wake
Longshoremen&#x27;s tattoo, carved (Belphagor docks)
Unfolding tableau, gold &amp; aluminum etching of hive-mates &amp; ancestors 
Pitons (handful)</span>

Some of these garments quite interesting and intriguing (those fashioned from what I assume to be Displacing Beast Hide, the one “Of The Bat”, etc.) but the most common seem to just simply possess only protective properties or were woven by delicate Elfin hands to predictable effect.

I&#x27;ve had a cascade of realizations over the past 48 hours and I feel like if I don&#x27;t write them all down somewhere they&#x27;re all going to fly out of my head. I have no idea whether this will be useful to anyone, but at least I&#x27;ll be able to link it to people if they ask me &quot;hey what ever happened to that G&amp;G thing you were making.&quot;
This is my second post about the failure of a big project called Goblets &amp; Grues, although the last project under that name was only partially related. (There&#x27;s a small part of me that&#x27;s embarassed to write again about my failures, but the rest of me knows that if things are especially hard for me to learn, that just means I&#x27;ll learn it better.

                              <span>Doors are so often stubbornly Stuck in Dungeons. What is it about those places that makes it so hard to hire a decent Doormaker? Having tried to hang a Door exactly once in my life and making a major mess of it, I suppose I sympathize.
 Naturally, it’s seldom down to the artisans involved. With a more Mythic Underworld approach, in some of these frightening places every Door might require some Forcing for delvers and interlopers (while they are whisper quiet and open readily for Monsters of course). The Dungeon knows Her children and permits them to travel throughout freely as one of Her Dark Gifts. This creates a remarkably interesting pacing mechanism and can lead to tenser exploration. I tend to let a few of them swing freely, but still try to sprinkle in a few “Stuck” ones here and the…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve enjoyed creating these Weird Mecha / Golem for MRD2. Two of the PCs in my MRD2 Campaign are using them (Chemysterious Cascader and Lycaon Strain), and one of them showed up as an enemy in a cliffhanger in the previous session. Those two are arguably more concrete than some of the other ones, which is ok, but I do really want to test the viability of abstract &quot;Mecha&quot; and exploring those possibilities both subtextually and in terms of how they open up the game in new ways.


The two current posts include tables for superorganism mecha and embodied cognition mecha. In this post, I&#x27;ll create a few mecha combining both of these tables.

 So, this is a table about Generating Diseases, giving them Names for Settings that might benefit from less generic germs. As I was working on it, I decided that rather than fixate on the Effects, it would potentially be more useful to incorporate Rumors of Cures/Treatments that might be available for a given sickness.
