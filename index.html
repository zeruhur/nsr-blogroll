 So often in Modules and Published Adventures, Traps are tragically under-telegraphed. Oftentimes, they are at least properly indicated on the provided maps/grids with a “T” and we might see a terse description of their primary function/effect (often in the form or Recommended Saving Throws), but seldom are there any telltale indicators that can be used to foreshadow these dangers.
 I prefer to assume competency with Adventurers. The characters are well aware that these locations full of Treasure that they’ve found themselves exploring are fraught with perilous dangers, even if the Players might be more cavalier in terms of their approach. In addition to threats from Monsters, Running out of Resources, Getting Lost, or even the Dungeon Itself, the…</span>

                              <span>I am having a really hard time explaining people what I do when I run games. It is the next section I am trying to work on for FLoK, but even with the help of some folks who I have run games for, it is slow going. 
To help the process along, I figured I would make some qualitative systems that sort of line up with how I tend to do things at the table. Mind you, this isn&#x27;t what I actually consciously have in the back of my head while running, but I think using this will land you in a similar place. 

To help understand where I am coming from it might be useful to keep in mind what my number one principle is when running games: Fluff &#x3D; Crunch. Both for players, as well as for GMs.

With that out of the way, here&#x27;s some systems:

Tools, Tables, Mechanics, and Mosaics
Lines and Circles 

So this is a Mosaic Strict procedure that provides a structure for players to model a romantic relationship. In a lot of ways Lines and Circles strikes me as a lyric game. It’s interesting to read, beautiful in a way, esoteric, and only kind of a game. 

But then I think about how it might be more than that. The mechanics themselves aren’t much. You pick a type of relationship (line or circle) and progress through some scenes, negotiating what happens, and gaining and losing bond points as you go. Normally I avoid romantic relatio…</span>

I&#x27;ve put together a proof of concept for something I&#x27;ve been calling the Hexcrawl Dashboard: a patchwork of iFramed tools cobbled together onto a single site for ease of GM access.

Pig Faced Orc by Trash Mob Minis



In the game I play with the kids using RISUS, the orcs are Pig Men who are dirty, gluttonous and lazy. Evil is also comically evil in this game, because I’m playing with young kids. This makes these encounters and scenes a lot more fun than dangerous, though there is danger and —depending on the sensibilities of the kids— lethal. Though situations should play out in such a way that evil should not triumph but rather defeat itself.


I started thinking about this because in the game I play when we’re done early in class, the kid made it until the caves and decided to check out cave C. So I’ve been reading that entry lately, thinking about how I could run it for this 6 or 7 year old kid. And I tho…</span>

Reconciling these abilities can sometimes lead to interesting physical traits, which in turn can influence the description of the Creature 😊.</span>

I have a ton of folders of collected artwork for D&amp;D inspiration. I was just thinking to myself that they could make for a good post. Why not start here? 


I hope you like women in armor, because I have many digital binders full of &#x27;em. This collection skews towards European knight aesthetics because I&#x27;m a hack. Feel free to correct that in the comments by contributing more pics. 


I&#x27;ve tried to credit everyone. This isn&#x27;t exhaustive or anything, these are just the pieces I&#x27;ve come across over the years that I enjoyed enough to save.

(AND WHY SHOULD I CARE?) but my comment was too long so I&#x27;m just making it it&#x27;s own post in response. You should definitely read that post first or this response won&#x27;t make sense.

                              <span>Maximum Recursion Depth is now available on Exalted Funeral! It should be available print+pdf later today (as of posting). I&#x27;ve been vocal about the fact that I&#x27;m a very digitally-oriented person, but I&#x27;m still looking forward to having a copy of MRD physically in my hands, and I know many other people do prefer print so I&#x27;m glad to have an offering for them. Also, Exalted Funeral is an awesome publisher and it&#x27;s a real honor to be a part of their catalog. I hope that this exposes more people to MRD and my blog who I would not otherwise have crossed paths with.

                              <span>Stumbling  Towards  D&amp;D&#x27;s Alternate, Alternate Combat System


 



The combat mechanics of Classic fantasy RPGs are a huge source of both debate and game design innovation. The first official changes to Dungeons &amp; Dragons in “Supplement 1 - Greyhawk” are changes to combat mechanics (variable Hit Dice, including weapon damage and Hit Points by class) that form a central aspect of every subsequent edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Even now D&amp;D&#x27;s combat rules continue to evolve, increasing in complexity and offering ever more variability, steadily accreting to form the 100’s of pages of rules, customization options, feats, spells and mechanics that allow the current edition to function almost as a tactical game of fantasy superpowers and feat usage.

                              <span>Return to part 1

Continuing from part 2, I&#x27;m exploring some alternatives to the traditional role that money and economics plays in D&amp;D, inspired by real-life situations found in history, with the occasional creative liberty taken here or there to make things more gameable. It&#x27;s fantasy after all, we&#x27;re not going to stress about accuracy here. Last time I just talked about small-to-medium adjustments to the existing economic situations your players engage in. This time I want to think bigger picture. In traditional, OSR, &quot;XP for Gold&quot; schemes, dungeoneering is a path that leads to domains being built up for each individual player. But what other campaign arcs shaped by treasure can we imagine?
An important caveat for this: all specific numbers and variables are intentionally left ambiguous…</span>

                              <span>In moving forward with the idea of using Tarsos Theorem&#x27;s Concept Crafting for the basis of my Mecha Gear system in Maximum Recursion Depth 2, I have run a series of &quot;Mock Session 0 Playtests&quot;, discussing the setting, game mechanics, and character creation with people as if we were going to run a game (and in one case, it actually is going to be an ongoing IRL Campaign!).


I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised the extent to which people have responded really positively to the Playtests- it feels like I have demonstrably learned from MRD1 and have gotten better at conveying information and setting expectations, and also in game design itself. One of the playtests was with the first group I ran the earliest version of MRD1, and they said they liked the idea of MRD2 even better and were interested …</span>

Akin to my generator for Remarkable Birds, this kind of set dressing and these in-world “Common Names” can sometimes add a little bit of fun or interesting detail to the Wilderness Foraging, Catch-monger Stalls, or even the occasional Wave-Crawl. One column might also be useful for quick descriptors of seafood dishes the players might deign to dine upon.
 I’ve also included a handy Perchance Generator below to speed up generation of these aquatic critters.</span>

                              <span>As we have some time left over at the end of the lessons, we sometimes play some RPG. This goes very slowly as we&#x27;re playing it in sessions as short as 5 minutes at the time sometimes. This time, a student of 7 years old made an adventurer character called Robin the Ninja, using my regular Risus setup and B2 - Keep on the Borderlands.
So enter Jason the Ninja:


Ninja 4
Language Buff 3
Basketball Player 2
Cook 1


He decided he wanted to check out the caves for treasure so we went on our way and I rolled to see if there was a random encounter. Or I just decided to roll to see which random encounter he came upon, I can&#x27;t remember. It was weeks ago. I rolled up a giant gecko, which I just explained as a giant lizard. I googled a picture of a dimetrodon and showed that to him. I improvised a little scene to make it interesting. The beast was sunning on a log while a knight in armour with a broken shield and sword was laying on the ground going &quot;Ow! Ow! Owowowowowowow! That was a bad idea!&quot;
Jason the Ninja went on to kick the Giant Lizard (3) without getting a scratch on himself. I made it a drawn out combat encounter, rather than a one roll type of encounter. He didn&#x27;t get hit once, and made the lizard ran off (I let him narrate his own victory). He then carried the knight back to the castle to save him. I asked him his favorite colour and his favorite vegetable, because ... I dunno, it&#x27;s silly, and made it into the name of the knight. He had now made a friend. Sir Richard Bluecarrot will accompany him on his adventures from now on, if able. Jason immediately started to train the knight in the art of the Ninja &quot;so he can protect himself&quot;, providing him with a trampoline to practice his flips, succeeding in it.
And that&#x27;s where this part ended.
Sir Richard Bluecarrot:


Knight 3

This post will aim to answer the question, providing more depth to Shore Leave phases based on Mothership 1e mechanics. Using a downtime die and faction turns can create opportunities for new missions, and are generally helpful for worldbuilding. And as I say in every post, these rules are super modular. You can adjust them to your taste and the specifics of your campaign.
downtime die
While your characters rest in port, the world around them changes. The downtime die is a special kind of die that is rolled every Shore Leave phase. It is introduced to simulate the growth of various dangers and factions. Similar to the derelict die, it is meant as a guiding tool to help the warden flesh out the world.

The equipment cards from Mausritter/Last Gasp Grimoire are so fun. The gimmick is that you print out your equipment cards on card stock and use blue tack to stick them physically onto your character sheet, so you have a sort of Diablo pack experience.
I took this paradigm and applied it to decorations for the cozy hole that you call a home. All artwork is stolen from Mike Ploog&#x27;s background art in Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s Fellowship of the Ring.

ounding off this little run of tables, I decided to dust off another that’s been lingering in development for far too long. I’ve always been fond of unique Magic Users, but most of the time I don’t use or create a new Class/Subclass for them. There’s a significant amount of customization that can take place elsewhere to capture a different feel for a Wonder Worker, and in addition to just modifying Spell Lists/Creating New Spells, I like to tweak their process of Preparing Spells.
 These modifications are mostly cosmetic in nature and I’d assume that whatever materials or paraphernalia affiliated with these consumes about as much Inventory Space/Encumbrance as a standard Spellbook, and perhaps even possessses a degree of similar fragility. Losing a Spellbook is never fun, and I’m sure there are interesting and creative ways Players could discover that would end up with them losing access to some of these. 
 As I was working on this, it struck me that it might perform a bit of lovely double duty as a list of strange Rituals associated with woefully un-specified Spell Acquisition or under-detailed Magical Research as well. If the more traditonal Tome is still your personal preference, please see my previous One Hundred Grimoires Post for some ideas on how to snazz these 😊.</span>

                              <span>Somewhere in the 2009-2011 range, when I was just discovering the OSR scene, I ran across a retroclone which stuck out to me and zoomed up into my favorites for quite some time. In contrast to most of the other rulesets I had seen at the time, it had a lot of referee advice -- and it had safety tools. 
No, seriously! They were perhaps a bit rudimentary compared to the codified tools that are out there today, but I didn&#x27;t see many other rulesets (OSR or otherwise) including quotes like &quot;The Referee shall realize that Rule 0 is for the purpose of establishing the desired atmosphere for his campaign, and not as an excuse to abuse players or a license to be a despot at the game table… The Referee’s role is to challenge players, not victimize them.&quot; or &quot;Know your players.

I think that factions are a key driving force for campaign. When the crew interacts with one, they gain access to more resources, but also open themselves to more risk. More risk equals more opportunity for tense sessions and horror!
squads
Squad is a group of contractors united by mission and proficiencies. They are usually too expensive to be hired by individual characters, so most of the time they will be attached to a faction. Such faction squads will count as resources (which I will cover in a later post). Once a goal is set for a squad, they will complete it autonomously. If a character has a Command skill, they can also control a squad …</span>

                              <span>Musing the other day about Randomizing the Players’ Starting Equipment (why would this Magic User have a suit of Chainmail Armor?) got me thinking: What if some of a Character’s Initial Gear could serve as a bit of double duty somehow? It would be fun if one of the items they began play with had a little History, or even maybe an Adventure Hook/Rumor/bit of Mystery to pursue right out of the gate. As a big proponent of a more Sandbox-style of play, one can never have enough seeds to broadcast into those initially fallow fields in hopes that something sprouts, so naturally I felt another table was in order 😊.
   
At first, I had contemplated dividing this up into categories like Weapons/Armor/Tools and such, but gradually started leaning toward attempting to make the entries at least somewhat applicable to all (as you never know what the players will decide to spend that 3d6 x 100 on or select from my Quick Equipment &amp; Encumbrance Sheet). Some Referees perform this Shopping portion of Character Generation in play, and not all of these may be appropriate with that method, but there could be some inspiration found below for roleplaying cues I suppose.
 Gut-feeling tells me that these would likely work best with the more durable pieces of gear on the Adventure Equipment list of your choice but it might lead to interesting situations to attach something like this to a consumable like a single Torch or Arrow. Could lead to a tough choice down the road eventually. 
 I do have an additional d100 for Equipment here, but this list doesn’t include the “bread and butter” of Arms and Armor. Updated: with Perchance generator below.</span>

Perhaps not worshipped in a conventional sense by Clerics (though I don’t see why these wouldn’t work within the context of my system for Holy Taboos), these divinities govern what might seem like mundanity on the surface, but feel free to make them more important as necessary. Do they grant the occasional prayer of coincidence or serendipitous blessing? What sort of modest offerings does one tenderly place before their humble shrines? 
 I also managed to squeeze in a hundred names should you find yourself at a loss for one. And yes, I decided to do the entries within this table in couplets because I’m apparently a glutton for punishment 😊.</span>

                              <span>Folk and Fairy Tales abound with foes that can’t be bested in conventional ways. Some of the standard Monsters have a few hints of this quality: Lycanthropes and their susceptibility to Silver, the traditional Vampire vulnerabilities, etc. These all help grant things a more folkloric feel and generate minor puzzles/mysteries for the players to solve.
 Occasionally, it might be interesting to provide a Monster with a special Weakness or Achillies Heel, some form of flaw that might be exploited or sometimes serve as the only method of defeat. So, here’s a list of One Hundred Fairy Tale Weaknesses that might be useful. Sometimes discovering such secret things can even lead to adventure along the way. Some of these feature a little bit of ludic bleed (relying on things like Die color, or other things at the table itself), but I find that can sometimes be rather fun in moderation.</span>

It would make a great story that I will likely never write, but could also be a storygame TTRPG. I don&#x27;t normally play or run storygames, I used to listen to a bunch of Actual Plays of them but honestly at this point don&#x27;t know much about them, and don&#x27;t have sufficient time to invest in it, but I would love it if somebody with more knowledge and interest in storygames could help me carry this idea into some small side project. I&#x27;m somewhat less gung-ho on this now that it&#x27;s been several days since I had the dream and this would admittedly be a lot of work, but I do still love this idea and I suspect one way or another this will eventually influence som…</span>

                              <span>Character generation in the original FLoK was deliberately sparse because I had no real idea of what the project was going to be yet. 
It was also one of the areas my playtesters had the most feedback on. Especially the generation of the standard attributes (strength, dex, etc.) was contentious. 
Some disliked that that these tags didn&#x27;t really come into play, others liked how it informed their idea of their character and the way they roleplayed them. 
This made me consider making some Maze Rats inspired d66 tables to help those who like that input in visualising and roleplaying their character, without suggesting that these are tags which are supposed to come into play.
I also tried to standardise the equipment you get from backgrounds a bit more, allow folks to simply roll up their background and provide some examples of those &#x27;twist&#x27; items. All also in d66 tables. 
Here&#x27;s the current results:


All of this is still subject to revision and I might end up deciding I don&#x27;t like this form of character generation after all. However, the tables seem like they could be useful all the same, so I might as well share them. 
Next up is probably finishing my write up of GM and Player advise. I&#x27;ve noticed I find it hard to explain what I do quite naturally at the table, so I think I might try an example of play that does everything I tend to do when things go well and see if I can&#x27;t use that as a basis for writing up the advice.</span>

I have previously talked at length about the virtues of &quot;campaign-level play.&quot; That is, rather than only ever running your game as a series of mostly-isolated scenarios in episodic fashion and then calling it a &quot;campaign,&quot; you actually flesh out all the connective tissue between adventures. There are certain gameplay structures you can incorporate which aren&#x27;t really interacted with on a scenario-to-scenario basis, but which nonetheless have an impact on the campaign as a whole. Examples I give are things like a calendar and downtime play, usable maps and travel gameplay, complicated NPC relationship charts that&#x27;ll change over time, and of course, domain play and some slightly more in-depth economics than just a menu of regular adventuring gear.

                              <span>Yesterday was the last day before what we call &quot;krokusvakantie&quot; or &quot;crocus vacation&quot; also known as Carnaval Vacation. Carnaval being the Catholic dress-up feast before the start of Lent, also known as Mardi Gras, but not the Louisiana version of it. That&#x27;s not to say that for some adults it&#x27;s not also a bacchanal, but it&#x27;s mostly a party where kids dress up and have a fun day. There&#x27;s often parades etc.
But yeah. The kids were not in the mood for lessons, which I had anticipated. So, we played a roleplaying game. I only got to it with one group, which was a group of 9 year olds. I chose to run Keep on the Borderlands with RISUS, but have it more geared towards young kids. I know one of the kids in that class is easily upset by violence in stories etc.
I started the game with narrating that…</span>

                              <span>I have found, as an evergreen referee, that I&#x27;d much rather pilot NPCs than play a proper character in an ongoing campaign. I&#x27;ve mentioned this before, but as I consider today&#x27;s topic, it is especially relevant. 
NPCs are skeleton keys to the campaign world for referees. They are direct representations of tropes, themes, needs, and wants that you (if you&#x27;re running a game) want to convey to the players to make the setting come alive. I&#x27;d rather spend three hours playing a dozen+ NPCs than a single, titular character. I&#x27;ve learned this over time. It remains my staple experience in adventure games. 
This is brief preamble for my sharing with you my Meta NPCs. That is, my favorite NPCs that show up in just about all of my games regardless of genre or setting (tailored to fit, as necessary). I…</span>

                              <span>Back when I initially started this blog I was working on a GLoG hack for the table I played with at the time. It is somewhat finished, but barely playtested and the few people that did play it seemed to hate it. 
Moreover, this is from before I realised you don&#x27;t actually need rules for everything, so despite aiming for &#x27;elegant design&#x27; it is a rather convoluted mess of rules I thought I&#x27;d need because they were so prevalent in other systems, rules I wanted to add because I thought they were missing from 5e and a bunch of systems and mechanics stolen from other blogs merely because they looked interesting.

For these reasons, I don&#x27;t like looking back at it, it makes me cringe. However, every once in a while when I need an example of something I like, I find myself returning to stuff I wro…</span>
